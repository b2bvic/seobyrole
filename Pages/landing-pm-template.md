# SEO Keeps Getting Pushed to Next Sprint

## Your stakeholders want it. Your devs can't scope it. And you're the one stuck translating between two languages you don't speak.

**Get the Product Manager's SEO Scoping Template** — Sprint-ready tickets your engineering team can actually estimate.

## The Problem

You own the roadmap. SEO is on it somewhere between "high priority" and "we'll get to it."

Leadership asks when organic traffic will improve. Engineering asks what "optimize metadata" actually means. The SEO agency sends a 47-page audit with color-coded priority rankings that map to nothing in Jira.

You're caught between business goals that demand SEO and technical teams that can't scope it. The work either sits in backlog purgatory or ships half-finished because nobody knew what "done" looked like.

Not because SEO is impossible. Because it doesn't speak product language.

---

## The Solution

**Sprint-ready SEO ticket templates** that translate organic search work into the same structure your team uses for feature releases.

No "optimize the site." No "improve rankings." Just specific, estimable, testable work packets your devs can build and QA can verify.

Each template includes:
- Acceptance criteria written for engineers
- Definition of done that survives code review
- Scope boundaries so "SEO work" doesn't become infinite
- Time estimates based on complexity tiers
- Dependency mapping for release planning

You get five templates covering the SEO work that actually moves metrics. Your team gets tickets they can point in planning poker.

## What's Inside

### Template 1: Title Tag Optimization Sprint
Scoped work for metadata updates across page types. Includes QA checklist, character limit logic, and regression test requirements.

### Template 2: Internal Linking Audit & Implementation
Technical debt ticket for link structure. Maps crawl depth requirements to component-level changes.

### Template 3: Core Web Vitals Remediation
Performance optimization broken into measurable units. Connects Lighthouse scores to deployable fixes.

### Template 4: Schema Markup Deployment
Structured data implementation with version control requirements and testing protocols.

### Template 5: Content Gap Fill
Editorial + technical work combined. Includes content brief template, publishing workflow, and technical SEO QA.

### Bonus Framework: SEO Work Estimation Matrix
Complexity scoring system for sizing SEO tickets against your existing story point scale.

## Who This Is For

**You're a Product Manager who:**
- Owns a roadmap where SEO matters but isn't your core expertise
- Needs to translate agency recommendations into engineering work
- Gets asked "how long will this take" and has no framework for answering
- Wants SEO to ship like any other feature—scoped, estimated, tested

**This is NOT for:**
- SEO specialists looking for keyword research tools
- Engineers who already know how to implement technical SEO
- Agencies building client deliverables
- Anyone looking for content strategy or link building tactics

This is scoping infrastructure for PMs who need to ship SEO work through existing product development processes.

## Quick Win Preview

Here's what one template looks like in practice:

**Template: Title Tag Optimization Sprint**

**User Story:**
As a search engine, I need accurate, descriptive title tags on every indexable page so I can display relevant information in search results.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All product pages follow structure: `[Product Name] | [Primary Benefit] | [Brand]`
- [ ] Title length does not exceed 60 characters (verified via automated test)
- [ ] No duplicate titles exist across site (checked via crawl report)
- [ ] Dynamic title generation works for all page types (unit tested)

**Definition of Done:**
- Code merged to main branch
- QA verifies random sample of 20 pages across 4 page types
- Automated test added to CI/CD pipeline
- Crawl confirms zero duplication errors

**Estimated Effort:** 3 story points (template component update + test coverage)

**Dependencies:**
- Requires access to page template files
- May need CMS admin permissions for dynamic field mapping

That's one ticket. Estimable. Testable. Ships like anything else on your board.

## About the Creator

Victor Romo runs Scale With Search, where he helps businesses translate SEO strategy into operational reality. He's worked in real estate technology, built internal databases that handle millions in transaction data, and spent years turning "we need better SEO" into work that actually ships.

This template set comes from watching the same breakdown happen repeatedly: agencies deliver audits, PMs try to translate them, engineering can't scope the work, and nothing moves. These templates solve the translation problem.

No SEO guru credentials. Just product infrastructure for shipping organic search improvements through teams that build software.

## FAQ

**Q: I already have an SEO agency. Why do I need this?**

Your agency tells you what to fix. This tells your engineering team how to build it. Different problems. The gap between their recommendations and your sprint planning is where SEO work dies. These templates close that gap.

**Q: Will this work with our existing sprint structure?**

That's the point. These aren't new processes—they're SEO work formatted for the product development workflow you already use. If your team points stories and writes acceptance criteria, these templates plug directly in.

**Q: How technical do I need to be to use these?**

You need to understand how your team ships features. If you can write a user story for a button color change, you can use these templates. The technical SEO knowledge is already baked into the acceptance criteria.

**Q: We use [Jira/Linear/Azure DevOps/Monday]. Will these work?**

Yes. The templates are framework-agnostic. They follow standard user story structure that translates across project management tools. Import instructions included for Jira and Linear; other tools require manual setup but use the same format.

**Q: What if my engineering team pushes back on SEO work?**

They're pushing back on ambiguity, not SEO. "Improve site performance" is unscope-able. "Reduce Largest Contentful Paint to <2.5s by lazy-loading hero images" is a normal ticket. These templates give you the latter.
