## 2. LISEC (Lead Magnets)

3 role-specific lead magnets designed to capture emails and demonstrate immediate value. Each follows the LISEC framework.

### Lead Magnet 1: The Product Manager's SEO Scoping Template

**Format:** Editable Google Doc template + PDF walkthrough
**Target Role:** Product Managers
**Delivery:** Email download link after opt-in
**Upsell Path:** "SEO for Product Managers" mini-course

**LISEC Breakdown:**

**L – Lead with the problem:**
You're tasked with "improving SEO" but engineering wants actionable tickets, not vague requests. Without a structured scoping process, SEO projects stall in the backlog while revenue-driving features ship.

**I – Introduce the mechanism:**
The issue isn't that SEO is hard to prioritize—it's that SEO work is poorly defined. Developers can't estimate effort for "optimize content" or "fix technical issues." This template translates SEO outcomes into scoped, sprint-ready tasks.

**S – Show the solution:**
The SEO Scoping Template includes:
- Pre-filled user stories for common SEO requests (page speed, structured data, internal linking)
- RICE scoring worksheet to compare SEO vs other roadmap items
- Acceptance criteria developers can test against
- Time-boxing recommendations by project size
- Cross-functional checklist (who to loop in, when)

**E – Explain the proof:**
Used by product managers at [SaaS companies/notable clients]. Reduces scoping time from 4 hours to 45 minutes. Eliminates back-and-forth with engineering on "what does this actually mean?"

**C – Call to action:**
Download the template. Use it in your next sprint planning session. If you want the full playbook (how to build the business case, measure impact, and manage stakeholders), check out the "SEO for Product Managers" course.

---

### Lead Magnet 2: The 30-Minute Technical SEO Audit (No Developer Required)

**Format:** Interactive checklist (Notion template or PDF) + Loom walkthrough video
**Target Role:** Marketing Managers, CMOs, Founders
**Delivery:** Email download + embedded video tutorial
**Upsell Path:** "Technical SEO Fundamentals" course or "SEO for Executives" mini-course

**LISEC Breakdown:**

**L – Lead with the problem:**
Your agency sends monthly reports full of technical jargon. You're approving invoices for "fixing crawl errors" and "optimizing site architecture" but you don't know if the work is actually moving the needle—or if it's busy work.

**I – Introduce the mechanism:**
Most technical SEO issues can be spotted in 30 minutes using free tools. You don't need to understand how to fix them—you need to know they exist so you can hold your team or vendor accountable.

**S – Show the solution:**
This audit walks you through:
- Google Search Console (5 reports that matter, 20+ you can ignore)
- PageSpeed Insights (what scores actually impact rankings)
- Screaming Frog or Sitebulb (basic crawl for indexation issues)
- Manual SERP checks (is Google showing the right pages?)

Each section has "green light / yellow light / red light" criteria so you know what's critical vs cosmetic.

**E – Explain the proof:**
Used by non-technical marketing leaders to audit $10K/month agency retainers. Catches issues agencies missed (or didn't prioritize). Takes 30 minutes once you've run it twice.

**C – Call to action:**
Download the checklist and run your first audit this week. If you want to go deeper (understanding why these issues matter and how to fix them), the "Technical SEO Fundamentals" course breaks it all down.

---

### Lead Magnet 3: The SEO Responsibility Matrix (Who Owns What on Your Team)

**Format:** Interactive tool (Airtable or Notion database) + visual RACI chart (PDF)
**Target Role:** All roles (segmented email sequences by role afterward)
**Delivery:** Email link to Airtable base (duplicate to their account) or downloadable PDF
**Upsell Path:** Role-specific mini-course based on their selection

**LISEC Breakdown:**

**L – Lead with the problem:**
SEO projects fail because no one owns the work. Content thinks product should prioritize it. Product thinks dev should implement it. Dev thinks marketing should define it. Meanwhile, nothing ships.

**I – Introduce the mechanism:**
SEO requires cross-functional execution, but responsibility must be clear. The RACI framework (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) maps every SEO task to the role that should own it—no more "we're all responsible for SEO" nonsense.

**S – Show the solution:**
The SEO Responsibility Matrix maps 40+ common SEO tasks to 6 roles:
- Executive (budget, vendor selection, strategic goals)
- Product Manager (roadmap prioritization, feature scoping)
- Developer (technical implementation, performance optimization)
- Content Team (on-page optimization, content production)
- Marketing Manager (reporting, channel integration, vendor management)
- Founder (investment decisions, hiring, strategic direction)

Filter by your role to see exactly what you should own, what you should delegate, and who to loop in.

**E – Explain the proof:**
Eliminates "I thought you were handling that" gaps in SEO execution. Reduces project kickoff meetings from 90 minutes to 20 minutes by clarifying ownership upfront.

**C – Call to action:**
Download the matrix and share it with your team. If you want the full playbook for your role (how to execute your responsibilities and work with the other roles), check out the role-specific mini-courses.

## 3. ABRASIVISM + PASAIDA (Email Sequences)

2 email sequences using Abrasivism voice (direct, no-filler, observation-driven) structured with PASAIDA framework.

### Sequence 1: Welcome/Nurture (5 Emails)

**Trigger:** User downloads any lead magnet
**Goal:** Build authority, demonstrate role-specific value, soft-pitch mini-course
**Voice:** Observer Protocol—no sycophancy, no bullet-rhythm, no insight bows

#### Email 1: You're Not Bad at SEO. You're Just Using the Wrong Playbook.

**Subject:** You're not bad at SEO. You're just using the wrong playbook.
**Preview Text:** Most SEO advice assumes you're a consultant. You're not.

**PASAIDA Element:** Problem

**Body:**

Most SEO content is written for consultants. People who control the entire strategy, have direct access to developers, and can say "we're doing this" without negotiating for resources.

That's not your reality.

You're a [Product Manager / Marketing Manager / Developer / Executive] trying to fit SEO into a roadmap that's already full. You don't control content, dev, or budget. You have to build consensus, justify investment, and prove results to people who don't understand why SEO takes six months.

Generic SEO advice doesn't account for that. It tells you what to do, not how to navigate the politics, resource constraints, and competing priorities that make execution nearly impossible.

SEO By Role is different. It's built for people who execute SEO inside organizations where SEO is one priority among fifty.

Over the next few emails, I'll show you what that looks like for your role.

#### Email 2: Here's What You Actually Control (and What You Don't)

**Subject:** Here's what you actually control (and what you don't)
**Preview Text:** Stop trying to own things outside your scope.

**PASAIDA Element:** Agitation

**Body:**

One of the fastest ways to fail at SEO is trying to own things outside your control.

If you're a Product Manager, you don't control content production velocity. If you're a Developer, you don't control keyword strategy. If you're a Marketing Manager, you don't control engineering prioritization.

But most SEO advice treats these as assumptions. "Just publish more content." "Just fix the page speed issues." As if you can snap your fingers and make it happen.

You can't. And pretending you can creates two problems:

1. You waste time trying to influence things you have no authority over.
2. You neglect the things you *do* control that would actually move the needle.

Here's what you should own as a [role]:

[Role-specific list of 3-5 responsibilities, grounded in real constraints]

The rest? Either delegate it clearly or accept it's not happening.

Next email: how to execute the things you actually control without waiting for perfect conditions.

#### Email 3: The [Role-Specific] SEO Win You Can Ship This Week

**Subject:** The [Product Manager / Marketing Manager / Developer] SEO win you can ship this week
**Preview Text:** No dev resources. No budget. No executive approval.

**PASAIDA Element:** Solution

**Body:**

Most SEO projects take months. Roadmap negotiations, cross-functional alignment, implementation backlogs.

But there's always one thing you can do *this week* that moves the needle. No approvals. No dependencies. Just execution.

For [role], it's this:

[Specific, actionable task with 3-step breakdown. Example for Product Managers: "Run a RICE score comparison between your top 3 roadmap items and the top 3 SEO opportunities in your backlog. Share the results in your next planning meeting. Watch what gets prioritized."]

Why this works:

- It's scoped to your actual authority
- It produces a tangible output people can react to
- It doesn't require buy-in from 5 other teams

Do this once, and you'll have something to show in your next stakeholder conversation. Do it consistently, and you'll build a track record that makes bigger SEO projects easier to justify.

Want the full playbook? I built a mini-course for [role] that maps out 12 weeks of these high-leverage, low-dependency SEO plays.

#### Email 4: Why Your [Stakeholder] Doesn't Care About SEO (and What to Say Instead)

**Subject:** Why your [exec/PM/dev team] doesn't care about SEO (and what to say instead)
**Preview Text:** Stop explaining how SEO works. Start explaining what it unlocks.

**PASAIDA Element:** Authority

**Body:**

Your [executive/PM/developer] doesn't care about keyword rankings, backlinks, or domain authority.

They care about outcomes. Revenue. User acquisition cost. Product adoption. Engineering velocity.

When you pitch SEO using SEO language, you're speaking a language they don't understand. Worse, you're making them do the work of translating "improved rankings" into "why this matters to my goals."

They won't. They'll nod, say "sounds good," and deprioritize it the moment something urgent comes up.

Here's what to say instead:

[Role-specific reframing. Example for Product Managers talking to engineering: "This isn't an SEO project. It's reducing our customer acquisition cost by 40% over 12 months by capturing demand we're currently paying Google Ads for."]

Same work. Different framing. Completely different reception.

I've seen this shift turn "maybe next quarter" into "let's scope this for next sprint."

The mini-course for [role] includes 6 pitch templates you can copy/paste for your next stakeholder meeting.

#### Email 5: The Thing No One Tells You About SEO Success in [Role Context]

**Subject:** The thing no one tells you about SEO success in [your company/team/role]
**Preview Text:** It's not about doing more. It's about doing less, better.

**PASAIDA Element:** Incentive + Deadline + Action

**Body:**

Most people think SEO success means doing more. Publishing more content. Building more links. Optimizing more pages.

That works if you're a consultant with a team executing your strategy.

It doesn't work if you're a [Product Manager / Marketing Manager / Developer] with 10 other responsibilities and limited leverage over the people who do the actual work.

For you, SEO success looks different. It's not about doing more—it's about identifying the 3 things that would 10x your results and ruthlessly ignoring everything else.

The [Role] SEO mini-course is built around that principle. No 47-step implementation guides. No "everything you need to know about technical SEO."

### Sequence 2: Sales/Launch (7 Emails)

**Trigger:** User is on general email list (didn't purchase after welcome sequence)
**Goal:** Drive course purchase during launch window
**Voice:** Abrasivism—direct, no fluff, stakes-aware

---

#### Email 1: I'm Launching Something You'll Either Love or Ignore

**Subject:** I'm launching something you'll either love or ignore
**Preview Text:** SEO education for people who don't have time for SEO education.

**PASAIDA Element:** Problem

**Body:**

Most SEO courses are built for people who have time to "master SEO."

You don't. You have 47 other things on your plate, and SEO is one of them.

You don't need to become an SEO expert. You need to know exactly what to do in your role, how to get it prioritized, and how to prove it worked.

That's what I built. SEO By Role—mini-courses designed for [Product Managers / Marketing Managers / Developers / Executives / Founders / Content Teams].

Not "everything you need to know about SEO." Just the 3-5 things that matter for your specific job, broken into plays you can run without waiting for perfect conditions.

Launching Monday. If you want early access (and the lowest price it'll ever be), reply to this email and I'll add you to the list.

#### Email 2: Here's What's Inside (and What's Not)

**Subject:** Here's what's inside (and what's not)
**Preview Text:** No fluff. No "SEO 101" you've already heard.

**PASAIDA Element:** Solution

**Body:**

SEO By Role [Product Manager / Marketing Manager / Developer] course includes:

**Week 1-2: What You Actually Control**
- The 5 SEO responsibilities that fall under your role (and the 10 you should stop trying to own)
- Authority mapping: where you can act unilaterally vs where you need buy-in
- Quick-win audit: the one thing you can ship this week

**Week 3-4: Building the Business Case**
- Stakeholder pitch templates (copy/paste for your next meeting)
- RICE scoring for SEO vs roadmap priorities
- ROI modeling that survives executive scrutiny

**Week 5-8: Execution Playbooks**
- 4 high-leverage SEO plays scoped to your role
- Cross-functional collaboration (how to work with dev/content/product without dependencies stalling)
- When to say no to SEO requests that hurt your actual goals

**Week 9-12: Measuring and Reporting**
- Dashboards leadership will actually read
- Connecting SEO work to revenue outcomes
- Quarterly retrospectives (what to double down on, what to kill)

What's *not* inside:
- Generic "how to do keyword research" tutorials
- 47-step technical audits you'll never finish
- Theory without execution

This is a playbook, not a textbook.

Launches Monday. Early access price: $97 (goes to $197 after launch week).

#### Email 3: Why This Doesn't Exist Anywhere Else

**Subject:** Why this doesn't exist anywhere else
**Preview Text:** Everyone teaches SEO. No one teaches navigating the org chart.

**PASAIDA Element:** Authority

**Body:**

There are 10,000 SEO courses. Most of them teach the same thing: keyword research, link building, technical audits.

That's not your bottleneck.

Your bottleneck is:

- Getting engineering to prioritize SEO work when the roadmap is full
- Justifying SEO spend to executives who want paid-style attribution
- Coordinating with content teams when you don't control editorial
- Proving SEO worked when rankings improved but traffic didn't (or vice versa)

No one teaches that. Because most SEO educators are consultants who've never had to navigate an org chart, fight for budget, or get deprioritized in sprint planning.

I've done all of it. Agency side, in-house side, founder side. I've pitched SEO to boards, negotiated with PMs, and written tickets developers didn't hate.

This course is the stuff I wish someone had handed me before I learned it the hard way.

Launches Monday. $97 early access (back to $197 after launch week).

#### Email 4: The One Question That Tells Me If This Is for You

**Subject:** The one question that tells me if this is for you
**Preview Text:** If you answered yes, you need this. If no, you don't.

**PASAIDA Element:** Agitation

**Body:**

Here's the question:

**"Do you know what to do next in SEO, but you can't get it prioritized, resourced, or approved?"**

If yes, this course is for you.

If your problem is "I don't know what good SEO looks like," you need a different course. There are plenty of them. They'll teach you keyword research, technical audits, link building.

But if you *know* what needs to happen and the bottleneck is execution—getting buy-in, coordinating across teams, proving value to stakeholders who don't speak SEO—then this is the only course built for that problem.

Launches Monday. $97 for early access (goes to $197 after).

#### Email 5: What Happens If You Don't Fix This

**Subject:** What happens if you don't fix this
**Preview Text:** SEO stays in the backlog. You stay stuck explaining why it's not your fault.

**PASAIDA Element:** Deadline + Agitation

**Body:**

If you don't figure out how to navigate the politics, resource constraints, and prioritization battles around SEO, here's what happens:

- SEO stays in the backlog while revenue-driving features ship
- You keep explaining to leadership why SEO "takes time" while they wonder why they're paying for it
- Agencies send reports you can't verify, and you approve invoices hoping the work is actually good
- You get stuck in "I know what to do but I can't get it done" limbo

Six months from now, you're in the same place. Still responsible for SEO. Still not making progress.

Or you could spend 12 weeks learning how to execute in the environment you actually operate in—not the one SEO courses pretend exists.

Launches Monday. Early access ends Friday.

$97 now. $197 after.

## 4. OBSERVER PROTOCOL (Social Media Content)

Social content calendar using Observer Protocol voice—no sycophancy, no bullet-rhythm, no insight bows. Varies structure, stays direct and operational.

### LinkedIn Post Hooks + Angles (10)

---

#### Post 1: Product Manager Hooks

**Hook:** Your PM wants to prioritize SEO. Engineering wants scoped tickets. Here's the gap.

**Angle:**

PMs speak in outcomes. Developers need acceptance criteria.

"Improve SEO" isn't a ticket. "Reduce LCP from 4.2s to 2.5s by lazy-loading hero images" is.

The translation layer is your job. If you can't scope it, it won't ship.

Here's the framework I use: [mini-thread or link to lead magnet]

---

#### Post 2: Developer Hooks

**Hook:** Developers get blamed for "slow" sites. But 80% of page speed issues aren't in the code.

**Angle:**

The developer didn't choose the 4MB hero image. The developer didn't install 17 tracking scripts. The developer didn't embed an unoptimized YouTube video above the fold.

But "fix page speed" lands on the dev team's backlog.

If you're a developer, here's how to push back on requests that blame you for decisions you didn't make: [link to article]

---

#### Post 3: CMO/Executive Hooks

**Hook:** Your agency says rankings improved. Traffic didn't. Revenue didn't. What happened?

**Angle:**

Ranking for irrelevant keywords is easy. Ranking for keywords that drive revenue is hard.

If your agency reports "50 keywords on page one" but you're not seeing leads, they're optimizing for the wrong targets.

Here's what to ask in your next agency call: [link to audit checklist]

---

#### Post 4: Founder Hooks

**Hook:** Founders ask me "When should I start doing SEO?" Wrong question.

**Angle:**

The question is "When does SEO ROI beat paid?"

Before product-market fit? Probably never.

After you've saturated paid channels and CAC is climbing? Probably now.

Here's the decision tree I use with clients: [link to founder's guide]

---

#### Post 5: Content Team Hooks

**Hook:** "SEO content" sounds like writing for robots because most people do it wrong.

**Angle:**

Keyword stuffing died in 2013. Google's algorithm understands context now.

But SEO briefs still say "use this exact phrase 8 times."

If your content sounds robotic, the problem isn't SEO—it's bad SEO.

Here's how to integrate keywords without killing your voice: [link to content checklist]

---

#### Post 6: Marketing Manager Hooks

**Hook:** Last-click attribution makes SEO look useless. Here's why CMOs keep killing SEO budgets.

**Angle:**

User sees blog post → visits site → leaves → sees retargeting ad → converts.

Last-click attributes the conversion to the ad. SEO gets zero credit.

Multi-touch attribution fixes this. But most companies don't use it.

If you manage SEO and your attribution model is broken, you're fighting uphill.

Here's what to change: [link to attribution guide]

---

#### Post 7: Cross-Role Hooks (Responsibility Matrix)

**Hook:** SEO projects fail because no one owns the work.

**Angle:**

Product thinks dev should do it. Dev thinks content should do it. Content thinks marketing should do it.

Meanwhile, nothing ships.

I built a responsibility matrix that maps 40 SEO tasks to 6 roles. No more "we're all responsible for SEO."

Download it here: [link to lead magnet]

---

#### Post 8: Agency Audit Hooks

**Hook:** You're paying $10K/month for SEO. How do you know if the work is good?

**Angle:**

Most people can't tell the difference between good SEO work and busy work.

Agencies know this. So they send reports full of "we optimized 47 pages" without explaining if it mattered.

Here's how to audit an agency when you're not an SEO expert: [link to audit guide]

---

#### Post 9: SEO Forecasting Hooks

**Hook:** Your SEO forecast says traffic will double in 6 months. It won't.

**Angle:**

Most SEO forecasts ignore:
- Competitive displacement (someone has to lose rankings for you to gain them)
- Execution risk (you probably won't ship everything on time)
- SERP feature changes (your CTR assumptions are wrong)

Conservative forecasting survives executive scrutiny. Overpromising gets you fired.

Here's how to build forecasts that hold up: [link to forecasting template]

---

#### Post 10: Technical SEO for Non-Technical Roles

**Hook:** You don't need to understand how to fix technical SEO. You need to know it exists.

**Angle:**

Marketing managers, founders, executives—you're not going to learn how to implement schema markup or fix redirect chains.

But you should know when your agency is ignoring critical issues or focusing on cosmetic ones.

Here's a 30-minute audit you can run with free tools: [link to audit checklist]

### Twitter/X Thread Starters (10)

---

#### Thread 1: Product Manager SEO Prioritization

**Starter:** PMs ask me "How do I get engineering to prioritize SEO?" Wrong question. Better question: "How do I make SEO look like every other roadmap item?"

[Thread: RICE scoring for SEO, writing user stories devs understand, scoping SEO as features not "fixes"]

---

#### Thread 2: Developer Page Speed Myths

**Starter:** Developers get blamed for slow sites. But most page speed issues have nothing to do with code. Here's what actually kills performance (and who's responsible):

[Thread: Unoptimized images from design, 3rd-party scripts from marketing, hosting choices from ops]

---

#### Thread 3: SEO Agency Red Flags

**Starter:** Red flags in SEO agency proposals (from someone who's reviewed 100+ of them):

[Thread: "We guarantee rankings," "proprietary algorithm," vanity metrics in case studies, no client references, lack of process documentation]

---

#### Thread 4: Founder SEO Investment Timing

**Starter:** Founders: here's when to invest in SEO (and when to ignore it completely).

[Thread: Pre-PMF = focus on paid for speed, post-PMF + high LTV = SEO compounds, CAC rising = time to diversify]

---

#### Thread 5: SEO Content Without Keyword Stuffing

**Starter:** How to write SEO content that doesn't sound like a robot wrote it:

[Thread: Write for the reader first, integrate keywords in H2s naturally, use synonyms and related terms, focus on intent not exact-match phrases]

---

#### Thread 6: Attribution Models That Credit SEO

**Starter:** Why last-click attribution kills SEO budgets (and what to use instead):

[Thread: Last-click gives credit to retargeting, multi-touch shows assists, brand search lift as SEO proxy, time-decay models]

---

#### Thread 7: SEO Responsibility Breakdown

**Starter:** Who should own what in SEO? Here's the breakdown by role:

[Thread: Execs = budget/strategy, PMs = prioritization, Devs = implementation, Content = optimization, Marketing = reporting]

---

#### Thread 8: SEO Forecasting Reality Check

**Starter:** Your SEO forecast is fiction. Here's why:

[Thread: Ignores competition, assumes static CTRs, doesn't account for execution risk, no scenario planning]

---

#### Thread 9: Technical SEO Basics for Non-Devs

**Starter:** Non-technical folks: here's what you should understand about technical SEO (without learning to code):

[Thread: Crawlability = can Google see it, Indexation = will Google rank it, Page speed = does it load fast, Structured data = does Google understand it]

---

#### Thread 10: SEO vs Paid Decision Framework

**Starter:** "Should I do SEO or paid?" False choice. Here's the real question:

[Thread: What's your CAC on paid? What's your LTV? How fast do you need results? Do you have content that can rank? Decision tree walkthrough]

## PRODUCTION NOTES

**Article Production Order:**
1. SEO for Product Managers (highest commercial intent, clear use case)
2. SEO for Developers (underserved audience, high engagement potential)
3. SEO for CMOs (targets budget holders, upsell to team licenses)
4. SEO for Content Teams (largest addressable market)
5. SEO for Founders (top-of-funnel awareness, lower intent)
6. Remaining tactical articles (audits, forecasting, responsibility matrix)

**Lead Magnet Priority:**
1. SEO Responsibility Matrix (universal, segments by role after download)
2. Product Manager Scoping Template (highest perceived value for target demo)
3. 30-Minute Technical Audit (appeals to budget holders and agency managers)

**Email Sequence Deploy:**
- Welcome sequence: Deploy immediately upon site launch
- Sales sequence: Reserve for course launch events (3-4x per year)

**Social Content Rollout:**
- Week 1-2: Seed LinkedIn with role-specific hooks, drive to lead magnets
- Week 3-4: Layer in Twitter threads, repurpose LinkedIn top performers
- Week 5+: Establish content calendar rhythm, test formats, double down on what converts

**Cross-Linking Strategy:**
- Every article links to 2-3 other role articles (contextual, not footer spam)
- Every article links to 1 lead magnet (inline CTA mid-article)
- Every lead magnet upsells to 1 specific course (role-matched)
- Social posts drive to articles or lead magnets, never directly to paid courses

**Voice Consistency Check:**
- Run all content through Observer Protocol filter before publish
- If it sounds "inspiring" or "motivational," rewrite
- If it ends with a neat insight bow, cut the last paragraph
- If it opens with agreement/validation, delete the intro and start at the second paragraph
