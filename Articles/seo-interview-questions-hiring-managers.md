# SEO Interview Questions for Hiring Managers Who Don't Know SEO

You need to evaluate an SEO candidate. You do not understand SEO well enough to assess technical competence directly. This is not a problem — it is a constraint that can be designed around.

The best SEO hires are not the most technically proficient. They are the ones who combine sufficient technical knowledge with the ability to translate SEO into business outcomes, navigate cross-functional politics, and prioritize effectively under resource constraints. Those skills you can evaluate regardless of your SEO knowledge.

This guide provides interview questions organized by competency, with evaluation criteria that do not require you to understand the technical details of the answers.

## Competency 1: Strategic Thinking

These questions evaluate whether the candidate approaches SEO as a business growth channel or as a set of tactical activities. Strategic thinkers connect SEO to revenue, competitive positioning, and organizational goals. Tacticians describe activities without connecting them to outcomes.

### Question: "If you joined our company tomorrow, what would your first 90 days look like?"

**Strong answer signals:** The candidate describes a discovery phase (audit, stakeholder interviews, competitive analysis) before proposing strategy. They mention connecting organic goals to business objectives. They acknowledge needing to understand the business before making recommendations.

**Weak answer signals:** The candidate immediately prescribes tactics — "I'd fix the title tags, start a blog, build links." This reveals someone who applies a template rather than analyzing the specific situation.

**Why this works without SEO knowledge:** You are evaluating process maturity, not technical choices. A strategic thinker in any discipline starts with diagnosis before prescription.

### Question: "How do you decide what to work on first when everything seems important?"

**Strong answer signals:** The candidate describes a prioritization framework. They mention evaluating impact against effort, business relevance, and competitive opportunity. They give a specific example of deprioritizing a popular SEO tactic because it did not align with business goals.

**Weak answer signals:** The candidate lists generic best practices or says they would "do everything" simultaneously. This indicates inability to make strategic tradeoffs — a critical weakness for a first SEO hire operating with limited resources.

### Question: "Describe a time when your SEO recommendation was rejected by engineering or leadership. What happened?"

**Strong answer signals:** The candidate describes the situation, explains why they believed their recommendation was correct, details how they adapted their approach (provided more data, reframed the business case, found a compromise), and shares the outcome. They demonstrate resilience and political awareness.

**Weak answer signals:** The candidate has no example (they have never had recommendations rejected, which means they have never pushed for anything significant) or they describe the rejection with resentment (blaming engineering or leadership rather than adapting).

## Competency 2: Analytical Ability

These questions evaluate whether the candidate makes decisions based on data or intuition. Data-driven SEO practitioners produce measurable, attributable results. Intuition-driven practitioners produce activities that may or may not create business value.

### Question: "Walk me through how you would measure the success of an SEO initiative."

**Strong answer signals:** The candidate defines specific metrics before the initiative starts, establishes a baseline measurement, describes a timeframe for evaluation (not "immediately" — SEO takes months to show results), and distinguishes between leading indicators (rankings, impressions) and lagging indicators (traffic, revenue).

**Weak answer signals:** The candidate says "traffic" or "rankings" without defining how those metrics connect to business outcomes, or without establishing a measurement methodology.

### Question: "Tell me about a time when SEO data told you something surprising. What did you do with that insight?"

**Strong answer signals:** The candidate describes a specific data discovery — a page ranking for unexpected keywords, a technical issue revealed through crawl data, a competitor move identified through ranking shifts. They explain the business implication and the action they took.

**Weak answer signals:** The candidate cannot recall a specific example. This suggests they review data superficially rather than mining it for insights.

### Question: "How do you separate correlation from causation in SEO? Give me an example."

**Strong answer signals:** The candidate explains that many SEO changes happen simultaneously — algorithm updates, competitor actions, seasonal patterns — and that attributing results to a single action requires careful analysis. They describe a specific instance where they isolated variables to determine what actually drove a result.

**Weak answer signals:** The candidate does not understand the question or attributes all positive outcomes directly to their actions without acknowledging confounding variables. This is a sign of inexperience or intellectual laziness.

## Competency 3: Communication and Collaboration

These questions are the most important for a first SEO hire. The ability to secure resources from engineering, explain value to leadership, and coordinate with content teams determines whether SEO work gets done.

### Question: "Explain SEO to me right now, as if I were a CEO who needs to decide whether to invest in it."

**Strong answer signals:** The candidate uses business language — revenue, customer acquisition cost, competitive positioning, market share. They avoid jargon. They are concise. They frame SEO as an investment with projected returns, not a mysterious art form that requires trust.

**Weak answer signals:** The candidate defaults to technical language (algorithms, crawl budget, backlink profiles) without translating to business impact. Or they oversimplify to the point of inaccuracy ("SEO gets you to the top of **Google**").

**Evaluation tip:** If you understand their explanation easily and it makes you want to invest in SEO, they are a strong communicator. If you feel confused or unconvinced, they will struggle to secure internal resources.

### Question: "How do you get engineering teams to prioritize SEO work when they have competing demands?"

**Strong answer signals:** The candidate describes framing SEO requests in engineering terms (user stories, acceptance criteria, sprint estimation). They mention using data to quantify the business impact of SEO engineering work. They describe building relationships with engineering leads, not just submitting tickets.

**Weak answer signals:** The candidate says they escalate to management when engineering does not prioritize their requests. This approach burns political capital fast and is not sustainable.

Candidates who understand cross-functional dynamics can reference frameworks from the [SEO for product managers guide](/articles/seo-for-product-managers.html) or describe similar approaches from experience.

### Question: "What does your ideal working relationship with a content team look like?"

**Strong answer signals:** The candidate describes a collaborative model where SEO provides keyword research and structural guidance while respecting editorial quality and creative voice. They understand that content teams produce better work when given direction without micromanagement.

**Weak answer signals:** The candidate describes a command-and-control relationship where they dictate keywords, structure, and word count to writers. This approach produces technically optimized but editorially poor content that neither ranks well nor serves users.

## Competency 4: Technical Foundation

You cannot evaluate technical SEO depth directly. But you can probe for foundational understanding using questions that reveal whether the candidate truly understands the technical landscape or merely parrots terminology.

### Question: "If our website traffic dropped 30% overnight, what would you do?"

**Strong answer signals:** The candidate describes a diagnostic process — check **Google Search Console** for manual actions or indexing issues, verify that no technical deployment broke the site, compare against known algorithm update dates, segment the traffic drop by page type and keyword category to identify the scope of impact. The answer is structured and systematic.

**Weak answer signals:** The candidate guesses at a single cause without describing a diagnostic framework. "It's probably an algorithm update" or "check for penalties" without a systematic approach suggests they would not effectively troubleshoot real problems.

### Question: "In plain language, what is the difference between technical SEO and content SEO?"

**Strong answer signals:** The candidate explains that technical SEO ensures **Google** can access, understand, and evaluate your site correctly (speed, structure, crawlability). Content SEO ensures the information on your pages matches what people are searching for and provides genuine value. Both are necessary. Neither alone is sufficient.

**Weak answer signals:** The candidate cannot clearly distinguish the two or provides an answer that only a technical person would understand. First SEO hires need to communicate both dimensions to diverse stakeholders.

### Question: "What SEO tools do you use regularly, and what specifically do you use each one for?"

**Strong answer signals:** The candidate names specific tools and describes specific use cases. "I use **Ahrefs** for competitive keyword gap analysis, **Google Search Console** for indexation monitoring and query performance, **Screaming Frog** for technical audits, and **Google Analytics 4** for conversion attribution." Each tool has a purpose.

**Weak answer signals:** The candidate names tools without explaining what they do with each one, or names only one or two tools. A practitioner who relies on a single tool has gaps in their analytical approach.

## Competency 5: Results Orientation

### Question: "What is the most impactful SEO result you have produced? Walk me through the before, the strategy, the execution, and the measured outcome."

**Strong answer signals:** The candidate provides specific numbers — traffic before and after, revenue impact, timeline, ranking changes. They describe the strategy reasoning, the execution steps, and the measurement methodology. The story has a beginning (problem), middle (approach), and end (verified result).

**Weak answer signals:** Vague numbers ("traffic doubled"), undefined timelines ("over time"), or attribution claims that seem inflated ("I grew the company's organic traffic to $5M in revenue" when they were one of twelve marketing team members).

### Question: "Tell me about an SEO strategy that did not work. What did you learn?"

**Strong answer signals:** The candidate owns the failure, describes what they expected to happen, explains why it did not work, and details what they changed as a result. Intellectual honesty about failure indicates learning capability and maturity.

**Weak answer signals:** The candidate cannot describe a failure, attributes all failures to external factors (algorithm changes, uncooperative engineering teams), or provides a disguised success story ("I tried X, it didn't work initially, but then it worked great").

## The Scoring Framework

Rate each competency on a 1-4 scale:

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1 | No evidence of competency. Answers are vague, generic, or absent. |
| 2 | Basic evidence. Candidate demonstrates awareness but limited depth. |
| 3 | Strong evidence. Candidate provides specific examples with measurable outcomes. |
| 4 | Exceptional evidence. Candidate demonstrates depth, nuance, and strategic thinking beyond the question scope. |

Minimum thresholds for a first SEO hire:
- **Strategic Thinking:** 3
- **Analytical Ability:** 3
- **Communication:** 3 (most critical for first hire)
- **Technical Foundation:** 2 (can be developed on the job)
- **Results Orientation:** 3

A candidate who scores 4 in technical foundation but 2 in communication will struggle as a first SEO hire. Invert the scores, and the candidate has much higher probability of success.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long should the SEO interview process be?

Three rounds: an initial culture/communication screen (45 minutes), a technical assessment with a practical exercise (90 minutes), and a cross-functional fit round with engineering and content leads (45 minutes each). Total candidate time: approximately 4 hours across 2-3 sessions spread over 1-2 weeks.

### Should I involve an external SEO expert in the interview?

Yes, if possible. Hire a freelance SEO consultant for $500-$1,000 to conduct the technical assessment round. This is a small investment relative to the cost of a bad hire. The external expert evaluates technical depth and strategic quality that you cannot assess directly.

### What if a candidate has great soft skills but limited SEO experience?

For a first SEO hire, prioritize experience over soft skills. You need someone who can produce results independently, because there is no internal mentor to guide their development. For subsequent hires where the first hire provides mentorship, optimizing for soft skills with less experience becomes viable.

### Are take-home assessments appropriate for SEO interviews?

Highly appropriate. Provide sanitized **Google Search Console** and **Google Analytics** data and ask the candidate to produce a written analysis with the top 3 opportunities and proposed actions. Limit the expected time investment to 2-3 hours. This practical assessment reveals more about working capability than any interview question.

### How do I verify an SEO candidate's claimed results?

Ask for specifics: which URLs, which keywords, what time period, and through which tools was the result measured? Request references from direct managers or clients who can verify the claims. Strong candidates welcome verification because their results are real. Weak candidates become vague when pressed for details.
