# Startup SEO: First 90 Days Framework for Founders

You launched three months ago. Paid ads drain cash. Referrals are inconsistent. Organic traffic: 47 sessions last month, zero conversions. Your competitor with worse product and design ranks page one for every keyword you need.

Early-stage startups skip SEO because results take months. The irony: that delay is why starting immediately matters. Content published today ranks in 90 days. Content you don't publish today costs you traffic six months from now.

This 90-day framework prioritizes the 20% of SEO work that generates 80% of results. No comprehensive audits. No enterprise tools. Just tactical execution that proves organic traffic converts before scaling investment.

## Week 1-2: Foundation (Days 1-14)

### Day 1-3: Technical Setup

**Objective**: Ensure Google can crawl, index, and rank your site.

**Tasks**:

**Set up Google Search Console**:
- Verify domain ownership
- Submit XML sitemap
- Check Coverage report for indexation errors

**Set up Google Analytics 4**:
- Install tracking code on all pages
- Configure goals/conversions (signups, demo requests, purchases)
- Verify data is flowing

**Generate and submit XML sitemap**:
- Most platforms (WordPress, Webflow, Shopify) auto-generate sitemaps
- Submit at `yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml` in GSC
- If no auto-generation, use a sitemap generator tool

**Check robots.txt**:
- Visit `yourdomain.com/robots.txt`
- Ensure it doesn't block important pages
- Common mistake: Staging sites have `Disallow: /` which blocks everything—don't copy that to production

**Verify mobile responsiveness**:
- Test on [Google's Mobile-Friendly Test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly)
- Fix any mobile usability issues (small fonts, tiny tap targets)

**Check page speed**:
- Run [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev) on homepage and key pages
- Target: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1
- Quick fixes: compress images, enable caching, remove unused plugins

**Deliverable**: GSC and GA4 configured, sitemap submitted, no critical technical blockers.

### Day 4-7: Competitor Research

**Objective**: Identify winnable keywords and content gaps.

**Process**:

**Find 3-5 direct competitors**:
- Companies selling similar products/services
- Similar size (don't compare against enterprises if you're a startup)

**Analyze their top pages** (Ahrefs/Semrush free tools or paid):
- What keywords do they rank for?
- Which pages get the most organic traffic?
- What content format (blog posts, tools, comparison pages)?

**Identify keyword gaps**:
- Keywords competitors rank for that you don't
- Focus on keywords with 100-1,000 monthly searches and low difficulty (KD < 30 in Ahrefs)
- These are winnable in 90 days without extensive backlinks

**Export 50-100 target keywords**:
- Spreadsheet with columns: Keyword, Search Volume, Difficulty, Search Intent (commercial/informational)
- Prioritize commercial keywords (bottom-of-funnel: "best X," "X alternatives," "X vs Y")

**Deliverable**: Keyword list with 50-100 targets, prioritized by winnability and commercial intent.

### Day 8-14: Content Strategy

**Objective**: Plan your first 10 articles.

**Content mix**:
- **40% commercial** (4 articles): Comparison posts, alternatives, "best X for Y"
- **40% product-related** (4 articles): How-tos, use case guides, problem-solution content
- **20% long-tail** (2 articles): Specific, low-competition queries with clear intent

**Example for a project management tool**:
1. "Asana vs Monday.com: Which Is Better for Small Teams?" (commercial)
2. "10 Best Project Management Tools for Remote Teams" (commercial)
3. "Asana Alternatives for Budget-Conscious Startups" (commercial)
4. "How to Set Up Project Management Workflows in 30 Minutes" (product-related)
5. "Project Management for Construction Companies: Complete Guide" (product-related)
6. "How to Track Project Progress Without Micromanaging" (product-related)
7. "5 Project Management Mistakes Killing Your Team's Productivity" (product-related)
8. "Project Management Software for Nonprofits Under $50/Month" (long-tail)
9. "How to Migrate from Trello to [Your Product]" (long-tail)
10. "Project Management KPIs Every Manager Should Track" (informational but converts)

**Content briefs**:
- For each article, note:
  - Target keyword
  - Search intent (what does the searcher want?)
  - Competitor articles to reference
  - Key points to cover
  - Word count target (1,500-2,500 words)

**Deliverable**: 10 content briefs ready for writing.

## Week 3-6: Content Production (Days 15-42)

### Writing Sprint

**Objective**: Publish your first 10 articles.

**If writing yourself**:
- Target 2-3 articles per week
- 1,500-2,500 words each
- Budget 3-4 hours per article (research + writing + optimization)

**If outsourcing**:
- Hire freelance writers ($0.10-0.15/word)
- Provide content briefs
- Edit for accuracy and SEO optimization

**On-page SEO checklist** (for every article):
- [ ] Target keyword in title (first 50 characters)
- [ ] Target keyword in first 100 words
- [ ] H1 matches title
- [ ] 5-8 H2 headings (question format or benefit-driven)
- [ ] 3-5 internal links to related content
- [ ] 2-3 external links to authoritative sources
- [ ] Meta description 150-160 characters
- [ ] URL slug clean and keyword-rich
- [ ] Alt text on all images
- [ ] At least one original image
- [ ] Mobile-friendly formatting (short paragraphs, bullet lists)

**Publishing cadence**:
- Week 3: 3 articles
- Week 4: 3 articles
- Week 5: 2 articles
- Week 6: 2 articles

**Deliverable**: 10 published articles optimized for target keywords.

### Internal Linking

**Objective**: Connect articles so Google understands topical relationships.

**Process**:
- As you publish each new article, link to 3-5 related articles already published
- Go back to older articles, add links to new articles
- Use descriptive anchor text: "Learn more about [project management workflows](slug.html)" not "click here"

**Hub-and-spoke structure**:
- Choose 1-2 articles as "pillar" content (comprehensive guides)
- Link all related articles to the pillar
- Pillar links back to each related article

**Deliverable**: Every article has 3-5 internal links; no orphan pages.

## Week 7-10: Early Link Building (Days 43-70)

### Tactic 1: Founder Networks

**Effort**: Low | **Impact**: Medium | **Timeline**: Week 7

**Process**:
- Y Combinator companies (if applicable): YC company directory links
- Accelerator/incubator alumni pages: Most list member companies with website links
- Co-founder personal sites/portfolios: Link to your startup
- University entrepreneurship programs: Alumni directories

**Target**: 3-5 backlinks from DR 30-50 domains.

### Tactic 2: Product Hunt & Launch Communities

**Effort**: Medium | **Impact**: Medium | **Timeline**: Week 7-8

**Process**:
- Launch on Product Hunt (free backlink from DR 90+ domain)
- Post on Hacker News "Show HN" (if tech product)
- Reddit relevant subreddits (r/SaaS, r/startups, r/entrepreneur) — participate authentically, not spammy
- Indie Hackers: Create project page, participate in community

**Target**: 2-4 backlinks from high-authority tech/startup communities.

### Tactic 3: Tool Directories & Listings

**Effort**: Low | **Impact**: Low-Medium | **Timeline**: Week 8-9

**Process**:
- G2, Capterra, Software Advice (for SaaS products)
- Industry-specific directories (e.g., "marketing tools," "design resources")
- "Awesome" lists on GitHub (if relevant)
- AlternativeTo (list your product as alternative to competitors)

**Target**: 10-15 directory backlinks (most nofollow, but still valuable for discoverability).

### Tactic 4: HARO (Help a Reporter Out)

**Effort**: Medium | **Impact**: High | **Timeline**: Week 9-10

**Process**:
- Sign up at helpareporter.com (free)
- Receive 3 daily emails with journalist requests
- Respond to 2-3 relevant queries per week
- Provide specific data, quotes, or expert insights

**Response rate**: 1 in 10-15 responses converts to a published article with backlink

**Target**: 1-2 backlinks from DR 60+ news/media sites.

**Deliverable**: 15-25 total backlinks acquired by day 70.

## Week 11-13: Optimization & Measurement (Days 71-90)

### Week 11: Content Performance Analysis

**Objective**: Identify what's working.

**Metrics to review** (in Google Search Console):
- **Impressions**: How often your pages appear in search results
- **Clicks**: Actual visits from search
- **Average position**: Where you rank for target keywords
- **CTR**: Click-through rate (clicks ÷ impressions)

**Questions to answer**:
- Which articles are getting impressions but low clicks? (CTR problem—rewrite title/meta description)
- Which keywords rank positions 11-20? (On the edge of page one—these are optimization opportunities)
- Which articles have zero impressions? (Not ranking yet—give it more time or improve content)

**Actions**:
- Update 2-3 articles with low CTR (rewrite titles and meta descriptions)
- Add 300-500 words to articles ranking positions 11-20 (expand content, add examples)
- Request indexing in GSC for articles with zero impressions

### Week 12: Technical Audit

**Objective**: Fix issues that emerged over 90 days.

**Run a site crawl** (Screaming Frog free version up to 500 URLs):
- Check for broken links (404s)
- Identify orphan pages (zero internal links)
- Find missing meta descriptions
- Detect duplicate content issues

**Fix priorities**:
1. Broken internal links (update or remove)
2. Orphan pages (add internal links from related content)
3. Missing meta descriptions (write them)
4. Redirect chains (simplify to direct redirects)

**Check Core Web Vitals** (GSC > Core Web Vitals):
- Are pages passing LCP, FID, CLS thresholds?
- If not, prioritize fixing top 10 trafficked pages

**Deliverable**: Technical issues resolved, no critical errors remaining.

### Week 13: Reporting & Planning

**Objective**: Measure 90-day results, plan next 90 days.

**Metrics to report**:
- **Organic sessions**: Compare days 1-30 vs. days 61-90
- **Indexed pages**: GSC Coverage report (how many of your 10 articles are indexed?)
- **Rankings**: How many keywords in top 100? Top 50? Top 20?
- **Backlinks**: Total referring domains acquired
- **Conversions**: How many signups/demos from organic traffic?

**Expected results after 90 days**:
- **Traffic**: 200-800 monthly organic sessions (depends on keyword difficulty and domain authority)
- **Indexed pages**: 8-10 of 10 published articles
- **Rankings**: 5-15 keywords in top 50, 2-5 in top 20
- **Backlinks**: 15-25 total referring domains
- **Conversions**: 2-10 signups/demos from organic

**If results are below expectations**:
- **Traffic < 100 sessions**: Keyword targeting too competitive. Pivot to easier keywords.
- **Few rankings**: Content quality issue. Study top-ranking competitors, improve content depth.
- **Low conversions**: Traffic quality issue. Focus more on commercial keywords, less on informational.

**Plan for days 91-180**:
- Continue publishing 8-12 articles monthly
- Begin updating top-performing articles (add new info, re-publish with updated date)
- Scale link building (guest posting, more HARO, competitor backlink theft)
- Add programmatic SEO if applicable (tool pages, location pages, comparison matrices)

## Tools You Actually Need

**Essential** (free or cheap):
- Google Search Console (free)
- Google Analytics 4 (free)
- Google Keyword Planner (free with inactive Google Ads account)
- Screaming Frog (free up to 500 URLs)

**Nice-to-have** (budget $50-100/month):
- Ahrefs Lite ($29/month) or Ubersuggest ($29/month) for keyword research and backlink tracking
- Grammarly Premium ($12/month) if writing content yourself

**Don't buy** (not needed in first 90 days):
- Enterprise SEO platforms ($200+/month)
- Link building agencies ($2,000+/month)
- Content optimization tools like Clearscope ($170/month) — use manual SERP analysis instead

## Common Mistakes

**Targeting impossible keywords**: "Project management software" has 50K searches and DR 70+ competitors. You won't rank. Target "project management software for [specific niche]" instead.

**Publishing inconsistently**: 10 articles in week 1, zero for 10 weeks. Google rewards publishing velocity. Steady beats sporadic.

**Ignoring search intent**: Writing educational content when searchers want buying guides. Match content format to what already ranks.

**No internal linking**: Publishing 10 isolated articles with zero connections. Internal links tell Google which pages matter.

**Giving up too early**: Expecting traffic in week 2. SEO takes 60-90 days minimum. Content published today ranks in 8-12 weeks.

## FAQ

**What if I don't see any traffic after 90 days?**

Check: (1) Are articles indexed? (GSC Coverage report). (2) Are you ranking anywhere? (GSC Performance > Queries). (3) Are keywords too competitive? If indexed but not ranking, target easier keywords. If not indexed, investigate technical issues.

**Should I hire an SEO agency?**

Not yet. Agencies are efficient for scaling what already works. At 90 days, you're still validating that SEO converts. Execute this framework yourself or with a freelancer first.

**Can I use AI to write content?**

For research and outlining, yes. For final drafts, no. AI content lacks depth and unique insights. Google rewards E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)—AI can't provide firsthand experience.

**What if my competitors have 500 articles and I have 10?**

You're not competing on volume—you're competing on relevance. 10 highly-targeted articles optimized for low-competition keywords beat 500 generic articles. Niche down until you find winnable queries.

**Should I focus on SEO or paid ads?**

Run both if budget allows. Paid ads validate keywords quickly (7 days vs. 90 days for SEO). Use paid to identify converting keywords, then target those in SEO content.

**How much time does this framework require?**

15-20 hours per week if executing solo (10 hours writing, 5 hours optimization/link building). 5-10 hours per week if outsourcing writing.

**What's realistic traffic growth after 90 days?**

New domain: 200-500 sessions/month. Established domain (1+ year old): 500-1,500 sessions/month. High-authority domain (DR 40+): 1,000-5,000 sessions/month. Variables: keyword difficulty, content quality, backlink acquisition.

The first 90 days aren't about ranking #1 for competitive keywords. They're about proving organic traffic converts so you can justify scaling investment. Publish 10 articles, earn 20 backlinks, generate 10 conversions. That's validation. Then scale.
