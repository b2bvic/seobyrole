# SEO for CMOs—Managing SEO Spend When You Can't Measure It Like Paid

The board wants to know why you allocated $180,000 to SEO last quarter. They have the Google Ads dashboard open. Clean numbers. Defensible numbers. Then they ask about organic.

This is the CMO's SEO problem. Not whether SEO works—it does. The problem is proving it works to people who've been trained to expect paid-channel clarity from every marketing dollar.

## Why SEO Attribution Doesn't Work Like Paid Channels

### Multi-Touch Journeys Hide SEO Contribution

The original organic touchpoint that introduced your brand often gets no attribution credit.

### Ranking Changes Lag Investment by Months

Investment in January produces measurable results in August. This creates structural problems for quarterly-focused boards.

### Branded vs Non-Branded Traffic Distorts ROI

Separating branded from non-branded traffic requires custom configuration most analytics setups lack.

## Building an SEO Budget Model That Survives Board Review

### Forecasting Organic Traffic Using Historical Growth Rates

Build three scenarios: conservative, likely, aggressive. Present all three.

### Estimating CAC Savings from Paid-to-Organic Shift

Calculate your customer acquisition cost on paid channels. Map highest-cost paid keywords against organic rankings.

### Sizing SEO Investment Against Competitor Spend

Competitive benchmarking provides external validation for budget requests.

## Evaluating SEO Agencies Without Getting Sold Snake Oil

### Red Flags in Agency Proposals and Case Studies

Guaranteed rankings, vanity metrics in case studies, proprietary algorithms, and no client references in your industry.

### What to Ask in the First Call

Walk me through a campaign that failed. How do you prioritize keywords? How do you handle disagreements? How long before results?

## Reporting SEO to Executives Who Want Paid-Style Metrics

### Translating Rankings into Revenue Impact

Build the bridge: rankings to traffic to conversions to revenue.

### Building SEO Dashboards Leadership Will Actually Read

Three questions: Is organic traffic growing? Is that traffic converting? What's the outlook? One page. Three sections.

### Explaining Why "SEO Takes 6 Months" Without Sounding Defensive

Frame delay as investment, not failure. Compare to category norms.
