# Founder's SEO Quick Wins - 90-Day Playbook for Bootstrapped Growth

You're a founder at $500K ARR. Paid acquisition costs $150 per customer. You need cheaper distribution, but you can't afford a $10K/month agency or a full-time SEO hire.

**Good news:** The highest-ROI SEO tactics don't require agencies or engineering sprints. You can execute them yourself in 10-20 hours over 90 days and see 30-50% traffic lifts.

This playbook focuses on quick wins—high-impact, low-effort tactics that deliver measurable results without technical complexity.

## Why Quick Wins Matter for Founders

SEO compounds slowly. Content strategies take 6-12 months. Technical overhauls require engineering resources. Founders need proof of concept before committing major resources.

**Quick wins prove SEO viability.** If you execute 5 quick wins and see 30% traffic growth in 90 days, you've validated organic as a channel. You can then justify hiring an SEO specialist or agency.

**What qualifies as a "quick win":**
- Executable in <10 hours
- No engineering required (or <2 hours of eng time)
- Measurable impact within 30-60 days
- Applicable to most business models

## Quick Win #1: Fix Your Google Business Profile (Local Businesses)

**Time:** 2 hours
**Impact:** 20-40% increase in "near me" searches
**Best for:** Local businesses (restaurants, clinics, agencies)

**Google Business Profile** (formerly Google My Business) controls how your business appears in local search and Maps.

**What to do:**

### Step 1: Claim and Verify Your Profile
1. Go to **business.google.com**
2. Search for your business name
3. Claim ownership (Google sends verification postcard to your address)

### Step 2: Complete Your Profile 100%
Google favors complete profiles. Fill out:
- Business hours (mark as "open" or "closed" for holidays)
- Phone number, website, email
- Services offered (list all your offerings)
- Attributes (e.g., "women-led," "veteran-owned," "wheelchair accessible")
- Business description (200-750 characters, keyword-rich)

**Example description:**
"Acme Coffee Roasters is a specialty coffee shop in downtown Portland serving single-origin pour-overs, espresso drinks, and fresh pastries. We roast beans in-house weekly and offer free WiFi for remote workers. Open 7am-7pm daily."

### Step 3: Upload Photos
Profiles with photos get 35% more clicks. Upload:
- Logo (square, 250x250px minimum)
- Cover photo (landscape, 1200x900px)
- Interior photos (5-10 images)
- Product photos (your menu, services, products)
- Team photos (builds trust)

### Step 4: Add Posts Weekly
Google Business Posts are mini-updates that appear in your profile. Post:
- Weekly specials ("20% off lattes this week")
- Events ("Live music Friday 7pm")
- New products ("Try our new cold brew nitro")

### Step 5: Respond to Reviews
Profiles with review responses rank higher. Reply to every review:
- Positive reviews: "Thanks for the kind words, Sarah! We're glad you enjoyed our cappuccino."
- Negative reviews: "We're sorry your experience wasn't great, John. Please email us at support@ so we can make it right."

**Expected outcome:**
- Searches for "[your business name] near me": +40%
- Map pack visibility: +30%
- Calls/directions clicks: +25%

**Tracking:** Monitor **Google Business Profile Insights** (shows search queries, actions taken, photo views).

## Quick Win #2: Optimize Your Top 10 Pages

**Time:** 5 hours
**Impact:** 15-25% traffic lift on high-traffic pages
**Best for:** Any business with existing traffic

Most sites have 10-20 pages that drive 80% of traffic. Optimizing those pages yields disproportionate returns.

**What to do:**

### Step 1: Identify Top Pages
1. Open **Google Analytics 4**
2. Go to **Reports > Engagement > Pages and screens**
3. Sort by **Sessions** (last 90 days)
4. Export top 10 pages

### Step 2: Optimize Title Tags
Title tags are the most important on-page SEO element.

**Current (weak):**
> "Blog - Acme Coffee"

**Optimized (strong):**
> "Best Specialty Coffee in Portland | Single-Origin Pour-Overs | Acme Coffee"

**Rules:**
- 50-60 characters (longer gets truncated in SERPs)
- Include primary keyword
- Add brand name at end
- Make it compelling (users click)

### Step 3: Optimize Meta Descriptions
Meta descriptions don't directly impact rankings, but they influence click-through rate.

**Current (weak):**
> "Read our blog about coffee."

**Optimized (strong):**
> "Discover Portland's best specialty coffee at Acme Coffee Roasters. We serve single-origin pour-overs, espresso drinks, and fresh pastries. Open 7am-7pm daily."

**Rules:**
- 150-160 characters
- Include keyword naturally
- Add call-to-action ("Discover," "Learn," "Try")

### Step 4: Add Internal Links
Link high-traffic pages to related content.

**Example:**
Your blog post "How to Brew Pour-Over Coffee" gets 5,000 visits/mo. Add internal links:
- "Check out our [pour-over coffee beans](#)"
- "Read our guide on [coffee grinder types](#)"
- "Visit our [Portland coffee shop](#)"

Internal links distribute authority and help Google discover related content.

### Step 5: Add Schema Markup
Structured data helps Google understand page content.

**For blog posts (Article schema):**
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "headline": "How to Brew Pour-Over Coffee",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Jane Doe"
  },
  "datePublished": "2026-02-08"
}
```

**For local businesses (LocalBusiness schema):**
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "CoffeeShop",
  "name": "Acme Coffee Roasters",
  "address": {
    "@type": "PostalAddress",
    "streetAddress": "123 Main St",
    "addressLocality": "Portland",
    "addressRegion": "OR"
  },
  "openingHours": "Mo-Su 07:00-19:00"
}
```

Use **Google's Structured Data Markup Helper** to generate schema.

**Expected outcome:**
- CTR increase: +10-20%
- Rankings improve: +2-5 positions on average
- Rich Results eligibility (stars, ratings, FAQs)

**Tracking:** Monitor **Google Search Console > Performance** for CTR and impressions.

## Quick Win #3: Fix Broken Links and 404 Errors

**Time:** 3 hours
**Impact:** 10-15% crawl efficiency improvement
**Best for:** Sites with >100 pages

Broken links waste crawl budget and frustrate users.

**What to do:**

### Step 1: Find Broken Links
Use **Screaming Frog SEO Spider** (free for <500 URLs):
1. Download and install
2. Enter your domain
3. Click "Start"
4. Filter by "Status Code" > 404

### Step 2: Fix or Redirect
For each 404 error:
- **If the page moved:** Add a 301 redirect to the new URL
- **If the page is obsolete:** Redirect to a relevant alternative
- **If the link is typo:** Fix the internal link

**Example:**
Old URL: `/blog/coffee-guide-2023` (404)
New URL: `/blog/coffee-guide-2026`

**Fix:** Add 301 redirect from old to new.

**How to add redirects:**
- **WordPress:** Use **Redirection** plugin
- **Shopify:** Settings > URL Redirects
- **Custom sites:** Add to .htaccess (Apache) or nginx config

### Step 3: Fix Broken External Links
Screaming Frog also identifies broken external links (links to other sites that return 404).

**Fix:** Update or remove dead links. Linking to 404 pages signals poor site maintenance.

**Expected outcome:**
- Crawl errors: -80%
- User experience: improved (no dead ends)
- Rankings: slight lift (better site health)

**Tracking:** Monitor **Google Search Console > Coverage** for 404 errors.

## Quick Win #4: Improve Page Speed (Lazy-Load Images)

**Time:** 2 hours
**Impact:** 20-30% improvement in Core Web Vitals
**Best for:** Image-heavy sites (e-commerce, blogs, portfolios)

Slow page speed hurts rankings and conversion rates. The single highest-ROI fix: **lazy-loading images**.

**What lazy-loading does:** Images below the fold don't load until users scroll. This reduces initial page weight by 40-60%.

**What to do:**

### Step 1: Check Current Performance
1. Go to **PageSpeed Insights** (pagespeed.web.dev)
2. Enter your homepage URL
3. Note your **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)** score

Target: LCP <2.5 seconds

### Step 2: Implement Native Lazy-Loading
Modern browsers support native lazy-loading. Add `loading="lazy"` to image tags:

**Before:**
```html
<img src="coffee-shop.jpg" alt="Acme Coffee Roasters interior">
```

**After:**
```html
<img src="coffee-shop.jpg" alt="Acme Coffee Roasters interior" loading="lazy">
```

**How to implement:**
- **WordPress:** Most themes include lazy-loading by default. If not, use **Lazy Load by WP Rocket** plugin.
- **Shopify:** Edit theme code and add `loading="lazy"` to image tags in liquid templates.
- **Custom sites:** Add attribute to all `<img>` tags except hero images.

**Exception:** Don't lazy-load above-the-fold images (hero, logo). Lazy-loading them delays LCP.

### Step 3: Compress Images
Use **TinyPNG** or **ImageOptim** to compress images without quality loss.

**Process:**
1. Upload images to TinyPNG
2. Download compressed versions
3. Replace originals on your site

**Alternative:** Use CDN-based compression (**Cloudflare Images**, **Imgix**).

**Expected outcome:**
- LCP improvement: 1-2 seconds
- Page weight reduction: 40-60%
- Bounce rate decrease: 10-15%

**Tracking:** Retest in **PageSpeed Insights** after 2 weeks.

## Quick Win #5: Add FAQ Schema to High-Traffic Pages

**Time:** 3 hours
**Impact:** 20-30% CTR increase via rich results
**Best for:** Content sites, SaaS, e-commerce

**FAQ schema** enables FAQ-rich results in SERPs—expandable question boxes that appear below your listing.

**What to do:**

### Step 1: Identify Target Pages
Pages with questions in content (guides, support docs, product pages).

### Step 2: Structure FAQs
Add an FAQ section to the page:

```markdown
## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is specialty coffee?
Specialty coffee refers to the highest grade of coffee beans...

### How do you brew pour-over coffee?
Pour-over brewing involves pouring hot water...
```

### Step 3: Add FAQ Schema
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is specialty coffee?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Specialty coffee refers to the highest grade of coffee beans..."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How do you brew pour-over coffee?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Pour-over brewing involves pouring hot water..."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Use **Google's Rich Results Test** to validate.

**Expected outcome:**
- Rich results eligibility within 30 days
- CTR increase: 20-30%
- SERP real estate: 2-3x larger

**Tracking:** Monitor **Google Search Console > Enhancements > FAQ** for indexing status.

## Quick Win #6: Target "Comparison" Keywords

**Time:** 5 hours
**Impact:** Capture high-intent traffic from competitor searches
**Best for:** SaaS, e-commerce, services

**Comparison keywords** signal buying intent. Users searching "ProductA vs ProductB" are evaluating options.

**What to do:**

### Step 1: Identify Comparison Queries
Use **Google Autocomplete**:
- Type "[Your Product] vs"
- Note suggested comparisons

Example: "ConvertKit vs Mailchimp," "ConvertKit vs ActiveCampaign"

### Step 2: Create Comparison Pages
Structure:
- **H1:** [ProductA] vs [ProductB] - Detailed Comparison [2026]
- **Intro:** Brief overview of both products
- **Comparison table:** Features side-by-side
- **Pros/Cons:** Honest assessment of each
- **Winner:** Recommend based on use case

**Example outline:**
> # ConvertKit vs Mailchimp - Email Marketing Platform Comparison
>
> ## Overview
> ConvertKit is a creator-focused email tool. Mailchimp is an all-in-one marketing platform.
>
> ## Feature Comparison
> | Feature | ConvertKit | Mailchimp |
> |---------|------------|-----------|
> | Automation | Advanced | Basic |
> | Pricing | Creator-tier | Free tier |
>
> ## Pros & Cons
> **ConvertKit:** Great for creators, steep learning curve
> **Mailchimp:** Easy to use, limited automation
>
> ## Recommendation
> Choose ConvertKit if you're a blogger. Choose Mailchimp if you need e-commerce integration.

### Step 3: Optimize for Snippet
Use a table for feature comparison—Google often pulls tables into featured snippets.

**Expected outcome:**
- Rank for 10-20 comparison queries
- Traffic: +500-2,000 sessions/mo per page
- High conversion (comparison traffic converts 2-3x better than informational traffic)

**Tracking:** Monitor rankings in **Ahrefs** or **Semrush**.

## Quick Win #7: Update Old Content with Fresh Dates

**Time:** 4 hours
**Impact:** 10-20% traffic recovery on declining posts
**Best for:** Blogs, guides, evergreen content

Old content loses rankings over time. Refreshing signals to Google it's still relevant.

**What to do:**

### Step 1: Identify Declining Content
1. Go to **Google Analytics 4**
2. Compare traffic (last 90 days vs. previous 90 days)
3. Filter for pages with -20%+ traffic decline

### Step 2: Update Content
- Add new statistics (replace 2023 data with 2026 data)
- Update outdated screenshots
- Add new examples or case studies
- Expand sections (add 200-500 words of new content)

### Step 3: Update Publication Date
Change the date in:
- URL (if date-based: `/2023/` → `/2026/`)
- Title tag ("Guide [2023]" → "Guide [2026]")
- First paragraph ("Last updated: February 2026")

### Step 4: Add "Last Updated" Banner
```html
<div class="updated-banner">
  <strong>Last updated:</strong> February 8, 2026
</div>
```

**Expected outcome:**
- Traffic recovery: 15-30% within 60 days
- Rankings improve: +3-8 positions

**Tracking:** Monitor **Google Search Console > Performance** for specific URLs.

## FAQ
