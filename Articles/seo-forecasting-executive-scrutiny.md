# SEO Forecasting That Survives Executive Scrutiny

The forecast said traffic would double in 6 months. It didn't. Now you're explaining why the projection was wrong and why the budget shouldn't get cut.

Most SEO forecasts are built to impress, not to inform. The framework below produces forecasts that survive board review because they acknowledge uncertainty instead of hiding it.

## Why Most SEO Forecasts Are Fiction

### Ranking Predictions Ignore Competitive Dynamics

Competitive displacement is zero-sum. Every ranking gain requires a ranking loss elsewhere.

### CTR Models Assume Static SERP Features

Your specific keywords don't match aggregate CTR behavior. SERP features change everything.

### Traffic Forecasts Don't Account for Execution Risk

Not everything planned will ship. Apply discount factors for execution probability.

## Building Conservative SEO Projections

### Using Historical Ranking Velocity as Baseline

Pull 12 months of Google Search Console data. Calculate your historical ranking velocity.

### Modeling CTR by Position and SERP Feature Presence

Build CTR models from your actual data, not generic benchmarks.

### Applying Discount Factors for Competitive Markets

Keyword difficulty scores guide discount factors from 0% to 70%.

## Presenting SEO Forecasts to Leadership

### Scenario Planning: Best Case, Likely Case, Worst Case

Present ranges instead of point estimates. Let executives choose their planning basis.

### Showing Assumptions Instead of Hiding Them

Document ranking assumptions, CTR assumptions, execution assumptions, and competitive assumptions.

### Connecting Traffic Projections to Revenue Impact

Translate visits to business outcomes through the conversion chain.

## When to Walk Back Overpromised Forecasts

### Recognizing When Projections Won't Hit

Monitor leading indicators. Flag risk early before the miss becomes a surprise.

### Explaining Variance Without Sounding Defensive

State the variance, identify drivers, quantify each factor's impact, explain what changes going forward.

### Resetting Expectations Mid-Project

Waiting until the quarterly review to announce a miss is worse than revising mid-quarter.
