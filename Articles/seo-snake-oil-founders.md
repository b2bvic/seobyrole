# SEO Snake Oil: Red Flags Founders Should Watch For When Hiring Agencies or Specialists

**SEO snake oil** thrives because search ranking feels like alchemy to non-technical founders—mysterious, results-delayed, impossible to validate in real-time. **Bad SEO agencies** exploit this opacity with guaranteed rankings, proprietary "secret formulas," and vanity metrics (domain authority, keyword count) that predict nothing about revenue. A founder who accepts "we'll rank you #1 for 50 keywords in 90 days" without asking which keywords or measuring conversion rate wastes $10K-$50K before discovering the keywords were low-volume, zero-intent garbage. A founder who celebrates "domain authority increased from 35 to 42!" without tracking organic revenue just paid for a scoreboard upgrade that didn't affect the game.

The operating system: **legitimate SEO takes 6-12 months, delivers measurable traffic and revenue, and explains methodology transparently**. If an agency promises faster results, secret tactics, or refuses to show their work, they're selling snake oil. This guide catalogs 12 red flags that signal fraud, incompetence, or misalignment—plus the questions founders should ask before signing contracts.

## Red Flag 1: Guaranteed Rankings (Especially for Competitive Keywords)

**The pitch:** "We guarantee first-page rankings for 'project management software' within 90 days or your money back."

**Why it's snake oil:** No one controls Google's algorithm except Google. Rankings depend on domain authority (built over years), content quality, backlinks, technical infrastructure, and 200+ ranking factors—most of which take 6-12 months to materialize. Agencies that "guarantee" rankings either: (1) target low-competition, low-volume keywords no one searches ("project management software Wyoming"—10 searches/month), or (2) use black-hat tactics (PBNs, link farms, keyword stuffing) that work temporarily before Google penalizes your site.

**How to verify:** Ask: "Which specific keywords are you guaranteeing, and what's the monthly search volume for each?" If they won't specify keywords upfront, or the keywords have <100 searches/month, walk away. Legitimate SEO targets high-volume, high-intent keywords and forecasts rankings as probabilities ("70% chance of top 10 within 6 months"), not guarantees.

**Legitimate alternative:** Agency says: "We'll target these 20 keywords (shows list with search volume). Based on our analysis, we expect 10-15 to rank in top 10 within 6-12 months. We'll measure progress monthly and adjust strategy if rankings don't materialize by month 6." This is honest forecasting, not snake oil.

## Red Flag 2: "Secret Proprietary SEO Formula" or "Algorithm Insider Knowledge"

**The pitch:** "Our proprietary SEO formula guarantees results. We can't share details—it's our competitive advantage." Or: "We have insider connections at Google who give us algorithm updates early."

**Why it's snake oil:** SEO best practices are public. Google publishes ranking guidelines (Google Search Essentials), industry experts share tactics openly (Ahrefs, Moz, SEMrush blogs), and case studies reveal what works. Anyone claiming "secret formulas" is either lying (using standard tactics repackaged as proprietary) or using black-hat tactics they don't want to disclose (PBNs, cloaking, link schemes). As for "Google insiders"—Google employees sign NDAs and can't share algorithm details. Anyone claiming insider access is fabricating it.

**How to verify:** Ask: "Can you explain your methodology at a high level?" Legitimate agencies describe their process: keyword research → content creation → technical optimization → backlink acquisition. If they refuse to explain anything ("it's proprietary"), they're hiding incompetence or fraud.

**Legitimate alternative:** Agency says: "We use standard SEO tactics: keyword research with Ahrefs, content clusters modeled after Backlinko's skyscraper technique, technical audits with Screaming Frog, backlinks via digital PR. We'll show you exactly what we're doing monthly." Transparency signals competence.

## Red Flag 3: Focus on Domain Authority, Not Traffic or Revenue

**The pitch:** "We increased your domain authority from 28 to 35 this quarter! Your SEO is improving."

**Why it's snake oil:** Domain authority (DA) is a proprietary metric from Moz that predicts ranking potential. It's not a Google ranking factor, and it doesn't measure business outcomes. A site with DA 50 and zero traffic is worthless. A site with DA 30 and 100,000 organic sessions is valuable. Agencies that report DA instead of traffic and revenue are optimizing for a scoreboard metric that doesn't affect the game.

**How to verify:** Ask: "How much organic traffic and revenue did we generate this month?" If they deflect to DA, keyword count, or "SEO health score," they're avoiding accountability for business outcomes.

**Legitimate alternative:** Agency reports: "Organic sessions: 10,000 (↑20% MoM). Organic conversions: 200 (↑15% MoM). Revenue from organic: $50K (↑18% MoM). Organic CAC: $250 (↓10% vs. paid CAC $500)." This measures business outcomes, not vanity metrics.

## Red Flag 4: Black-Hat Tactics (PBNs, Link Farms, Keyword Stuffing)

**The pitch:** "We'll build 500 backlinks in 30 days from high-authority sites." Or: "We'll optimize your pages with keyword density formulas."

**Why it's snake oil:** **Private blog networks (PBNs):** Networks of low-quality sites created solely to link to client sites. Google detects these and penalizes sites using them (manual penalty or algorithmic devaluation). **Link farms:** Services that sell bulk backlinks from spammy directories or comment spam. These hurt more than help. **Keyword stuffing:** Repeating target keywords unnaturally ("Best project management software for project managers who need project management solutions"). Google penalizes this for poor user experience.

**How to verify:** Ask: "Where will these backlinks come from? Can you show me examples?" Legitimate agencies target editorial backlinks from real publications (industry blogs, news sites, partner sites). If they refuse to show sources, or the sources are obscure directories and blog comment spam, walk away.

**Legitimate alternative:** Agency says: "We'll acquire 10-20 backlinks over 6 months from DR >40 sites via guest posts, digital PR, and partnerships. Here are examples of sites we've secured links from for past clients: [shows TechCrunch, Forbes, industry-specific publications]." This is white-hat link building.

## Red Flag 5: No Transparency on Work or Access to Tools

**The pitch:** "We'll handle everything. You don't need access to Google Analytics, Search Console, or our reports. We'll send monthly summaries."

**Why it's snake oil:** Agencies that block client access to tools and data are either (1) hiding low-quality work (thin content, spammy backlinks), (2) fabricating results (fake screenshots, inflated metrics), or (3) locking clients into dependency (client can't audit work or transition to new agency without losing all SEO knowledge).

**How to verify:** Demand: (1) Admin access to Google Analytics and Search Console (you own these accounts, not the agency), (2) Shared access to SEO tools (Ahrefs, SEMrush—view their keyword tracking and backlink reports), (3) Weekly or monthly reports showing what work was completed (content published, backlinks acquired, technical fixes deployed).

**Legitimate alternative:** Agency says: "We'll add you as admin to GA and GSC. You'll have view access to our Ahrefs project so you can see keyword rankings and backlink growth. We'll share a weekly progress report (content published, technical tickets completed, outreach results)." Full transparency.

## Red Flag 6: No Contract Flexibility or Exit Clauses

**The pitch:** "12-month contract, paid upfront, no refunds. If you cancel early, you forfeit all remaining fees."

**Why it's snake oil:** SEO takes 6-12 months to deliver results, but locking clients into non-refundable 12-month contracts with no exit clause traps them even if the agency delivers zero results. Legitimate agencies offer monthly contracts or quarterly commitments with performance milestones—if they don't hit milestones, client can exit.

**How to verify:** Negotiate: "3-month initial commitment, then month-to-month. We'll set milestones (e.g., publish 10 articles, acquire 5 backlinks, fix 20 technical issues). If milestones aren't met, we can exit with 30 days' notice."

**Legitimate alternative:** Agency says: "We recommend a 6-month engagement (SEO takes time), but we'll do 3-month initial commitment. If we hit agreed milestones (traffic +20%, 10 top-10 rankings, 50 backlinks), we'll extend to 6-12 months. If not, you can exit with 30 days' notice." This balances agency's need for runway with client's need for accountability.

## Red Flag 7: No Case Studies or Verifiable Past Results

**The pitch:** "We've helped hundreds of clients rank #1, but we can't share specifics due to NDAs."

**Why it's snake oil:** Every legitimate agency has 3-5 case studies they can share (even if anonymized: "SaaS client in project management space grew organic traffic from 5K to 50K sessions in 12 months"). Agencies that refuse to show any past work are either lying about results or delivering such poor outcomes that clients won't permit case studies.

**How to verify:** Ask: "Can you share 3 case studies with measurable results (traffic growth, revenue, rankings)? Can we talk to a past client?" If they refuse, walk away.

**Legitimate alternative:** Agency provides: (1) Case study deck with before/after screenshots (GA traffic, GSC rankings), (2) Client testimonials on LinkedIn or website, (3) Willingness to connect you with 1-2 past clients for reference calls. They'll protect sensitive data (won't share exact revenue or proprietary tactics), but they'll show proof of results.

## Red Flag 8: Overpromising Speed ("Rank in 30 Days")

**The pitch:** "We'll get you first-page rankings in 30 days using our accelerated SEO tactics."

**Why it's snake oil:** Google's crawl and indexation process alone takes 2-4 weeks. Building authority (backlinks, content depth) takes 3-6 months. Ranking for competitive keywords takes 6-12 months. The only way to rank in 30 days is: (1) Target zero-competition keywords (worthless), (2) Use black-hat tactics (short-term gain, long-term penalty), or (3) You already have a high-authority domain (then it's not the agency's magic, it's your existing equity).

**How to verify:** Ask: "What's the typical timeline to see results?" Legitimate agencies say: "Rankings start improving in 3-6 months, meaningful traffic growth by 6-9 months, ROI positive by 9-12 months." If they promise 30-60 days, they're lying or using black-hat tactics.

**Legitimate alternative:** Agency says: "SEO is a 6-12 month investment. Month 1-3: foundation work (technical fixes, content strategy, initial content). Month 4-6: rankings start improving, trickle of traffic. Month 7-12: rankings solidify, traffic compounds, ROI turns positive." Honest timeline setting.

## Red Flag 9: Charging Per Keyword or Per Ranking Position

**The pitch:** "We charge $500 per keyword ranked in top 10. Once we rank 20 keywords, you owe $10,000."

**Why it's snake oil:** This incentivizes agencies to target low-competition, low-volume keywords that are easy to rank but generate zero traffic or revenue. They'll rank you #1 for "project management software for left-handed freelancers in Montana" (1 search/month) and invoice you $500.

**How to verify:** Negotiate pricing based on outcomes (traffic, conversions, revenue), not keyword rankings. Better model: monthly retainer ($5K-$20K) tied to milestones (publish 10 articles, acquire 50 backlinks, increase traffic 20%).

**Legitimate alternative:** Agency says: "We charge $10K/month retainer. We'll target 20 high-volume keywords (shows list with search volume >500/month). Success is measured by organic traffic growth (+20% QoQ) and conversion rate (+3% → 5%). If we don't hit traffic targets by month 6, we'll reduce fees or extend the engagement at no cost." Performance-based retainer, not per-keyword pricing.

## Red Flag 10: No Reporting or Vague "SEO Health" Scores

**The pitch:** "Your SEO health score is 68/100 this month, up from 62 last month. Keep paying us and it'll improve."

**Why it's snake oil:** "SEO health scores" are composite metrics (mix of technical issues, backlinks, keyword count) that agencies invent to obscure lack of traffic or revenue growth. A site can have a "perfect" health score and zero visitors. What matters: organic sessions, conversions, revenue.

**How to verify:** Demand: Monthly report showing (1) organic sessions (GA4), (2) keyword rankings (top 10 positions only), (3) backlinks acquired (source URLs, DR of linking domains), (4) technical fixes completed (list of issues fixed), (5) content published (URLs, target keywords).

**Legitimate alternative:** Agency provides: "Monthly SEO report: Organic sessions: 15,000 (↑25% MoM). Top 10 keywords: 18 (↑3 vs. last month). Backlinks: +12 (from sites with DR >40). Content: Published 4 articles (URLs + target keywords). Technical: Fixed 8 broken links, optimized 15 images, improved LCP from 3.2s to 2.4s." Concrete data, not vague scores.

## Red Flag 11: Outsourcing Work to Cheap Offshore Teams Without Disclosure

**The pitch:** Agency in SF charges $15K/month but outsources writing to $5/hour content farms in developing countries, delivering low-quality, plagiarized, or AI-generated slop.

**Why it's snake oil:** Agencies mark up outsourced work 500-1,000% without disclosing it. You pay $15K, they spend $2K on contractors, pocket $13K. Fine if the work is high-quality, but often it's not—thin content, keyword-stuffed, plagiarized, or AI-generated without editing. This harms your site's rankings (Google penalizes thin/duplicate content).

**How to verify:** Ask: "Who will be writing our content? Can we review their portfolios? Can we approve writers before they're assigned?" Legitimate agencies either (1) hire in-house writers, or (2) use vetted freelancers and introduce them to clients.

**Legitimate alternative:** Agency says: "We have 3 in-house writers who'll handle your content. Here are their LinkedIn profiles and writing samples. You'll also have access to our project management tool to see who's assigned each task." Or: "We use freelancers from our network. We'll introduce you to the writers assigned to your account and you can approve/reject them." Transparency about who does the work.

## Red Flag 12: Ignoring Technical SEO or Claiming "Content Is Enough"

**The pitch:** "Just publish 100 blog posts and you'll rank. Technical SEO doesn't matter."

**Why it's snake oil:** Content without technical foundation fails. If your site has slow load times (LCP >3s), broken internal links, missing schema, or JavaScript rendering issues, Google won't index or rank your content no matter how good it is. Agencies that ignore technical SEO are cutting corners—technical audits require specialized skills (engineering collaboration, site architecture understanding) that content-only agencies lack.

**How to verify:** Ask: "Will you audit and fix technical SEO issues (site speed, schema, crawlability)?" If they say "that's not necessary" or "we don't do that," they're incompetent or lazy.

**Legitimate alternative:** Agency says: "Month 1: We'll run a technical audit (Screaming Frog, PageSpeed Insights) and provide a prioritized fix list. We'll work with your engineering team to implement fixes (schema, site speed, internal links). Month 2+: We'll publish content on a technically sound foundation." Technical SEO is foundational, not optional.

## Questions to Ask Before Hiring an SEO Agency or Specialist

**1. What's your methodology? Walk me through your process from month 1 to month 12.**

Legitimate answer: "Month 1-3: Technical audit + keyword research + content strategy. Month 4-6: Publish 20-30 content pieces, begin link building. Month 7-12: Content scales to 50+ pieces, backlinks compound, rankings solidify." If they can't articulate a clear process, walk away.

**2. Which specific keywords will you target, and what's the search volume for each?**

Legitimate answer: (Shows spreadsheet with 20-50 keywords, monthly search volume >100 per keyword, mix of bottom-of-funnel and middle-of-funnel terms). If they say "we'll figure that out later" or show keywords with <10 searches/month, walk away.

**3. How do you measure success? What metrics will you report monthly?**

Legitimate answer: "Organic sessions (GA4), keyword rankings in top 10 (GSC + Ahrefs), backlinks acquired (source URLs, DR), conversions from organic (trial signups, purchases), revenue attributed to organic (CRM or GA4 e-commerce)." If they report DA, "SEO health score," or vague "progress," walk away.

**4. Can you share 3 case studies with measurable results?**

Legitimate answer: (Provides case study deck with before/after screenshots: traffic growth, keyword rankings, revenue impact). Offers to connect you with 1-2 past clients for reference calls. If they refuse or have no case studies, walk away.

**5. What tools do you use, and will I have access to them?**

Legitimate answer: "We use Ahrefs (keyword tracking, backlinks), Screaming Frog (technical audits), GA4 and GSC (traffic, rankings). You'll have admin access to GA4/GSC and view access to our Ahrefs project." If they withhold access, walk away.

**6. What's your contract structure and cancellation policy?**

Legitimate answer: "3-month initial commitment with agreed milestones. If we hit milestones, we extend to 6-12 months. If not, you can cancel with 30 days' notice. No long-term lock-in until we prove results." If they demand 12-month upfront payment with no exit clause, walk away.

**7. Who will actually do the work (writing, link building, technical fixes)?**

Legitimate answer: "Our in-house team: 2 writers, 1 technical SEO specialist, 1 link builder. Or: We use vetted freelancers—we'll introduce you to them before starting." If they refuse to name names or say "our team" vaguely, they're likely outsourcing to low-quality contractors.

**8. How long until we see results?**

Legitimate answer: "Rankings improve in 3-6 months, meaningful traffic by 6-9 months, ROI positive by 9-12 months. SEO is a long-term investment." If they promise results in 30-60 days, walk away.

## FAQ: Avoiding SEO Snake Oil

### How do I know if an SEO agency is using black-hat tactics?

**Ask to see their link acquisition sources and review them manually.** Legitimate backlinks come from real sites (blogs, news outlets, industry publications) with editorial content and traffic. Black-hat backlinks come from obscure directories, blog comment spam, PBN sites (network of low-quality sites created for links). Red flags: backlinks from sites with no real content, sites with dozens of outbound links in footers, sites with unrelated topics (a pet blog linking to your SaaS product). Use Ahrefs or SEMrush to audit backlink sources—if 50%+ are low-DR (<20) directories or spam sites, the agency is using black-hat tactics.

### Should I fire my agency if they report DA instead of traffic?

**Yes, if they refuse to report traffic and revenue after you request it.** DA (domain authority) is a vanity metric. It predicts ranking potential but doesn't measure business outcomes. Legitimate agencies report organic sessions, conversions, and revenue monthly. If your agency deflects to DA when you ask for traffic data, they're avoiding accountability. Give them one chance to switch reporting to business metrics. If they refuse or claim "traffic isn't the right metric," fire them and hire an agency that measures outcomes.

### What's a reasonable timeline for SEO results?

**6-12 months for meaningful traffic and revenue.** Month 1-3: Foundation work (technical fixes, content strategy, initial content)—no traffic growth yet. Month 4-6: Rankings start improving (positions 10-20 → positions 5-10), trickle of traffic. Month 7-12: Rankings solidify (positions 3-7), traffic compounds, conversions materialize, ROI turns positive. If an agency promises results in 30-60 days, they're using black-hat tactics or targeting worthless keywords. If you see zero progress by month 6, audit their work (are they publishing content? acquiring backlinks? fixing technical issues?). If they're executing but rankings aren't improving, the strategy may be wrong (wrong keywords, weak content, poor backlinks)—consider switching agencies.

### Can I do SEO myself or should I hire an agency?

**Do it yourself if:** (1) You have 10-20 hours/week to dedicate, (2) You're technical (comfortable with GA4, GSC, HTML basics), (3) Your market is low-competition (keyword difficulty <30 for target terms). **Hire an agency if:** (1) You lack time (SEO is 10-20 hours/week minimum), (2) You're in a competitive market (keyword difficulty >50), (3) You need fast results (agencies have established processes and tools—they move faster than solo founders learning as they go). **Middle ground:** Hire a fractional SEO consultant (10-20 hours/month, $2K-$5K) to set strategy and audit work, then execute internally (write content in-house, use contractor freelancers for specialized work).

### What should I pay for SEO services?

**$2K-$5K/month for small businesses or startups (Seed-Series A).** **$5K-$15K/month for growth-stage companies (Series B-C).** **$15K-$50K+/month for late-stage or enterprises.** Pricing depends on scope (number of pages, content volume, technical complexity, backlink goals). Red flag: Agency charges <$1K/month (low-quality work, cut-rate contractors, no strategic input) or >$30K/month for a startup with <$1M ARR (overpriced, you're funding their bloat). Get 3 quotes, compare deliverables (content pieces/month, backlinks/month, technical fixes), and choose based on case studies + cultural fit, not just price.

---

**SEO snake oil** thrives on founder ignorance—guaranteed rankings, secret formulas, vanity metrics, and black-hat tactics disguised as "proprietary methods." Legitimate SEO is transparent (explains methodology, shares data access), outcome-focused (tracks traffic, conversions, revenue—not DA or health scores), and realistic (6-12 month timelines, no guarantees). Ask these questions before signing: methodology, target keywords, success metrics, case studies, tool access, contract terms, who does the work, and expected timeline. If an agency refuses to answer clearly, overpromises speed, or hides their work, walk away. When agencies align incentives around business outcomes (traffic, revenue, CAC) instead of gamed metrics (DA, keyword count), SEO delivers ROI. When they sell snake oil, founders waste $10K-$50K and 6-12 months before realizing they've been scammed. The question isn't whether SEO works—it does—it's whether you've hired someone who does it honestly.
