# SEO Writing Checklist for Content Writers: 22-Point Pre-Publish Audit

You wrote 2,400 words. The draft feels comprehensive. You're ready to hit publish. Then your SEO manager sends it back: missing meta description, thin H2 structure, no internal links, keyword appears only twice.

Most writers treat SEO as something added after writing—a separate optimization pass. The result: content that ranks poorly despite quality, or twice the time investment fixing what should have been right in the first draft.

This checklist integrates SEO into the writing process. Run through it before submitting any draft. Each item takes 30 seconds to 2 minutes. Total time: 15 minutes. The difference between invisible and ranking on page one.

## Section 1: Keyword Targeting (4 Checks)

### 1. Primary Keyword in Title (First 60 Characters)

**What to check**: Your target keyword appears within the first 50-60 characters of your title.

**Why it matters**: Google truncates titles beyond 60 characters in search results. Keywords near the beginning carry more weight.

**How to fix**:
- **Weak**: "A Comprehensive Guide to Understanding How Modern Teams Can Improve Email Marketing Results"
- **Strong**: "Email Marketing Guide: Improve Results for Modern Teams"

The keyword ("email marketing") moves from position 9 to position 1, and the title fits within 60 characters.

### 2. Primary Keyword in First 100 Words

**What to check**: Your exact target keyword appears in the introduction within the first 100 words.

**Why it matters**: Google's algorithms give more weight to terms appearing early in content. The introduction signals what the page is about.

**How to fix**: If your keyword is "content marketing strategy," your opening paragraph should include that exact phrase naturally:

"A content marketing strategy defines how you create, distribute, and measure content that attracts and converts customers."

Not: "Creating valuable content for your audience requires planning and systematization."

### 3. Keyword Density 0.5-1.5%

**What to check**: Calculate (keyword mentions ÷ total words) × 100. Aim for 0.5-1.5%.

**Why it matters**: Too low (<0.3%) and Google may not recognize topical focus. Too high (>2%) risks keyword stuffing penalties.

**How to calculate**:
- Article length: 2,000 words
- Primary keyword mentions: 15
- Density: (15 ÷ 2,000) × 100 = 0.75% ✓

**How to fix**: If density is low, find 3-5 places to naturally work in the keyword. If too high, replace some instances with synonyms or related terms.

### 4. LSI Keywords and Related Terms

**What to check**: You've included 10-15 semantically related terms that Google associates with your primary keyword.

**Why it matters**: Google's NLP identifies topical depth by recognizing related entities and concepts, not just primary keyword repetition.

**How to find related terms**:
- Google your keyword, scroll to "People also ask" and "Related searches"
- Use a tool like LSI Graph or Semrush's keyword magic tool
- Analyze top 3 ranking competitors—what terms do they all use?

**Example**: If writing about "email marketing automation," include: drip campaigns, triggered emails, workflow builder, email segmentation, lead nurturing, conversion tracking, API integrations, CRM sync.

## Section 2: Structure and Formatting (6 Checks)

### 5. H1 Matches or Closely Mirrors Title Tag

**What to check**: Your H1 tag (the article's main headline) matches or closely paraphrases your title tag.

**Why it matters**: Consistency signals relevance. Google expects H1 to clarify what the title promises.

**How to fix**:
- **Title tag**: "Email Marketing Automation Guide for SaaS Companies"
- **H1**: "Email Marketing Automation Guide for SaaS Companies" (exact match) or "The Complete Guide to Email Marketing Automation for SaaS" (close paraphrase)

One H1 per page. Never multiple.

### 6. H2s Structured as Questions or Benefit Statements

**What to check**: Your H2 headings use question format ("What is X?", "How does X work?") or benefit-driven statements ("Increase Conversion Rates with X").

**Why it matters**: Google extracts H2s for featured snippets. Question-formatted H2s directly match user queries.

**How to fix**:
- **Weak H2s**: "Overview," "Getting Started," "Conclusion"
- **Strong H2s**: "What is Email Marketing Automation?", "How Email Automation Increases Conversions," "Best Email Automation Tools for SaaS"

Aim for 5-8 H2s in a 2,000-2,500 word article.

### 7. H2-H3 Hierarchy Logical

**What to check**: H3s only appear under H2s. No H4s unless under H3s. No skipping levels (H2 → H4).

**Why it matters**: Proper heading hierarchy helps screen readers and search engine crawlers understand content structure.

**How to fix**:
```
H1: Email Marketing Automation Guide
  H2: What is Email Marketing Automation?
    H3: Definition
    H3: Core Components
  H2: Benefits of Email Automation
    H3: Increased Conversion Rates
    H3: Time Savings
  H2: How to Implement Email Automation
    H3: Step 1: Choose a Platform
    H3: Step 2: Build Workflows
```

### 8. Short Paragraphs (3-4 Sentences Max)

**What to check**: No paragraph exceeds 4-5 sentences or 100 words.

**Why it matters**: Online readers scan. Dense paragraphs reduce readability, increase bounce rate, and hurt rankings (Google tracks engagement signals).

**How to fix**: Break long paragraphs at logical transitions. Use whitespace generously. One idea per paragraph.

**Weak**:
"Email marketing automation allows you to send targeted emails based on user behavior. It's more effective than batch-and-blast campaigns because messages are personalized and timely. Studies show automated emails generate 320% more revenue than non-automated emails. This makes automation essential for SaaS companies looking to scale efficiently. Without automation, manually sending emails doesn't scale beyond 100 customers."

**Strong** (split into 3 paragraphs):
"Email marketing automation sends targeted emails based on user behavior. It's more effective than batch-and-blast campaigns because messages are personalized and timely.

Studies show automated emails generate 320% more revenue than non-automated emails. This makes automation essential for SaaS companies looking to scale efficiently.

Without automation, manually sending emails doesn't scale beyond 100 customers."

### 9. Bullet Points or Numbered Lists Every 300-400 Words

**What to check**: Visual breaks in the form of lists appear regularly, not just as an afterthought.

**Why it matters**: Lists improve scannability. Google often extracts lists into featured snippets.

**How to use**:
- Break up instructional content into step-by-step numbered lists
- Convert feature comparisons into bulleted lists
- Use lists for benefits, tools, or resources

### 10. Bold Key Terms and Entities

**What to check**: Important product names, technical terms, proper nouns, and concepts are bolded.

**Why it matters**: Google's NLP recognizes entities through formatting signals. Bolding tells Google "this term is important."

**What to bold**:
- Product names: **HubSpot**, **Mailchimp**, **ActiveCampaign**
- Technical terms: **drip campaigns**, **A/B testing**, **conversion rate**
- Key concepts: **lead nurturing**, **behavioral triggers**, **segmentation**

Bold 15-25 terms per 2,000-word article. Don't overdo it—bolding loses meaning if 50% of the text is bold.

## Section 3: Meta Tags and URLs (4 Checks)

### 11. Title Tag 50-60 Characters

**What to check**: Your title tag (what appears in search results) is 50-60 characters including spaces.

**Why it matters**: Google truncates titles beyond 60 characters with "...". Users won't see your full message.

**How to count**: Use a pixel-width checker (most SEO plugins show this) or count characters manually.

**Formula**: [Primary Keyword] + [Qualifier] + [Benefit or Year]
- "Email Marketing Automation Guide for SaaS Companies 2026" (56 chars) ✓
- "The Ultimate Comprehensive Email Marketing Automation Guide for SaaS Companies Using Modern Tools" (98 chars) ✗

### 12. Meta Description 150-160 Characters

**What to check**: Your meta description is 150-160 characters and includes:
- Primary keyword (Google bolds matching terms)
- Clear benefit or value proposition
- Call to action

**Why it matters**: Meta descriptions don't directly affect rankings, but they determine click-through rate. A 1% CTR improvement compounds to 30% more traffic annually.

**Example**:
"Learn email marketing automation for SaaS. Build workflows that convert trials to customers. Step-by-step guide with tools and templates." (151 characters)

### 13. URL Slug Clean and Keyword-Rich

**What to check**: Your URL is short (3-5 words), includes the primary keyword, and has no stop words.

**Why it matters**: Clean URLs rank better and are more likely to be clicked and shared.

**Weak URLs**:
- `domain.com/blog/2026/01/15/the-ultimate-guide-to-email-marketing-automation-for-saas-companies`
- `domain.com/p=12345`

**Strong URLs**:
- `domain.com/email-marketing-automation-saas`
- `domain.com/email-automation-guide`

Remove: dates, stop words (the, a, an, for, to), post IDs, unnecessary subdirectories.

### 14. No Keyword Stuffing in Meta Tags

**What to check**: Your title tag and meta description don't repeat the keyword unnaturally.

**Why it matters**: Google penalizes keyword stuffing. Users perceive repetitive meta tags as spam.

**Keyword-stuffed**:
"Email Marketing Automation | Email Marketing Automation Tools | Email Marketing Automation Guide | Email Marketing Automation Software"

**Optimized**:
"Email Marketing Automation Guide: Tools and Best Practices"

## Section 4: Internal and External Links (4 Checks)

### 15. 3-5 Internal Links in First 500 Words

**What to check**: You've linked to 3-5 related articles on your site within the first third of the article.

**Why it matters**: Internal links distribute authority, help Google discover content, and keep users on your site longer (reducing bounce rate).

**How to add**:
- Link to related topics mentioned in your intro
- Use descriptive anchor text containing keywords
- Example: "We cover [email segmentation strategies](slug.html) and [drip campaign examples](slug.html) in detail."

### 16. Anchor Text Descriptive, Not Generic

**What to check**: Your link anchor text describes the destination page's content. No "click here" or "read more."

**Why it matters**: Anchor text tells Google what the linked page is about. Descriptive anchors strengthen the target page's rankings for those keywords.

**Weak anchors**:
- "Click here to learn more about email automation."
- "Check out this article about drip campaigns."

**Strong anchors**:
- "Learn how to build [automated email workflows](slug.html)."
- "Our guide to [drip campaign best practices](slug.html) covers this in depth."

### 17. 2-3 External Links to Authoritative Sources

**What to check**: You've linked to 2-3 high-authority external sites (DR 60+) as sources for claims, data, or tools.

**Why it matters**: External links to authoritative sources signal that your content is well-researched. Google rewards content that cites reputable sources.

**What to link to**:
- Statistics: Link to the original study or report (not a blog post citing it)
- Tools: Link to official tool websites (HubSpot, Mailchimp, Salesforce)
- Definitions: Link to authoritative resources (Wikipedia for definitions, Google for technical docs)

**Example**: "According to [HubSpot's 2025 Marketing Report](https://hubspot.com/report), automated emails generate 3x more revenue than batch campaigns."

### 18. No Broken Links

**What to check**: All internal and external links return 200 status codes. None lead to 404 error pages.

**Why it matters**: Broken links harm user experience and waste link equity. Google interprets broken links as a signal of outdated or low-quality content.

**How to check**: Use a broken link checker tool (Chrome extension "Check My Links," or Screaming Frog for bulk checking).

## Section 5: Media and Technical (4 Checks)

### 19. At Least One Original Image Above the Fold

**What to check**: Your article includes at least one relevant image within the first 2-3 paragraphs, ideally a custom graphic, screenshot, or diagram.

**Why it matters**: Images improve engagement (reducing bounce rate). Google Image Search drives 22% of total Google traffic—images are a secondary ranking opportunity.

**Best practices**:
- Original > stock photos (Google rewards unique media)
- Relevant to content (not decorative filler)
- Compressed (under 200KB ideally, to avoid slowing page load)

### 20. Alt Text on All Images

**What to check**: Every image has descriptive alt text (10-15 words) that includes your keyword if relevant.

**Why it matters**: Alt text feeds Google Image Search. It also makes content accessible to screen readers.

**How to write alt text**:
- Describe the image literally: "Screenshot of email marketing automation workflow in HubSpot"
- Include keyword naturally if applicable: "Email marketing automation dashboard showing campaign metrics"
- Don't keyword stuff: Not "email marketing email marketing automation email automation tool"

### 21. File Names Descriptive Before Upload

**What to check**: Image file names describe content before uploading. Not `IMG_1234.jpg`.

**Why it matters**: Google reads file names as ranking signals for image search.

**Weak**: `IMG_1234.jpg`, `screenshot.png`, `image-final-final-2.jpg`
**Strong**: `email-automation-workflow-example.png`, `saas-email-funnel-diagram.jpg`

### 22. Page Loads in Under 3 Seconds

**What to check**: Use PageSpeed Insights or GTmetrix to test load time. Aim for under 3 seconds on mobile.

**Why it matters**: Page speed is a direct ranking factor. 1-second delay reduces conversions by 7% and increases bounce rate.

**Quick fixes if slow**:
- Compress images to WebP format
- Remove unnecessary plugins or scripts
- Enable caching
- Use a CDN for media hosting

## Pre-Publish Workflow

**Step 1: Write the draft** (focus on quality and clarity, don't over-optimize while writing)

**Step 2: Run through checklist** (15 minutes)
- Keyword checks (items 1-4)
- Structure checks (items 5-10)
- Meta tag checks (items 11-14)
- Link checks (items 15-18)
- Media and technical checks (items 19-22)

**Step 3: Use a content optimization tool** (optional but recommended)
- Run the draft through Clearscope, SurferSEO, or Frase
- Check optimization score (target 70-80+)
- Add any missing related terms or sections

**Step 4: Grammar and readability check**
- Run through Grammarly or ProWritingAid
- Fix passive voice, complex sentences, and errors
- Aim for Flesch Reading Ease score above 60 (8th-9th grade level)

**Step 5: Plagiarism check** (if required)
- Run through Copyscape or Grammarly's plagiarism detector
- Ensure < 5% similarity to any single source

**Step 6: Final proofread**
- Read the article aloud
- Check formatting in the CMS preview (headings, lists, bold, images)
- Verify all links open correctly

**Total time investment**: 15-25 minutes beyond writing the draft.

## Common Writer Mistakes

**Keyword placement feels unnatural**: If your keyword is awkward ("email marketing automation software tools"), target a more natural variation ("email marketing tools" or "email automation software"). Don't force unnatural phrasing for exact match.

**Ignoring search intent**: Writing a 3,000-word educational guide when the top-ranking results are comparison lists. Match content format to what's already ranking—Google has validated that format for that query.

**Overstuffing H2s with keywords**: "Email Marketing Automation," "Email Marketing Automation Tools," "Email Marketing Automation Best Practices"—this looks spammy. Use natural variations.

**No original insights**: Rewriting competitors' articles without adding new information. Google rewards content that includes original research, case studies, or proprietary data.

**Writing for yourself, not the searcher**: Using industry jargon or brand-specific terminology. If your target keyword is "email automation," don't exclusively call it your product's branded term. Speak the searcher's language.

## FAQ

**Do I need to hit every checklist item for every article?**

Yes for commercial and pillar content (product pages, ultimate guides, comparison posts). For lower-priority blog posts, prioritize items 1-6, 11-14, and 19-20. The full checklist takes 15 minutes—budget that time for high-value content.

**What if my keyword density is too high after writing naturally?**

Replace some keyword instances with synonyms or related terms. If your keyword is "email marketing," alternate with "email campaigns," "email strategy," or "marketing automation." Google understands semantic relationships—exact match repetition isn't required.

**Should I optimize for one keyword or multiple keywords per article?**

One primary keyword per article. But naturally include 5-10 related long-tail variations. If your primary keyword is "email automation," you'll naturally mention "automated email campaigns," "email workflows," "drip campaigns," etc. Google ranks a single page for dozens of related queries.

**How do I find LSI keywords without a paid tool?**

Google your primary keyword. Scroll to "People also ask" (copy those questions). Scroll to the bottom for "Related searches" (copy those terms). Check the top 3 ranking articles—what terms appear in their H2s? Those are semantically related terms Google expects.

**What if my editor changes my title tag after submission?**

Communicate checklist requirements upfront. Title tag optimization affects rankings directly—editors should know character limits and keyword placement matter. If edits are necessary for brand voice, negotiate adjustments that preserve SEO structure.

**Can I use AI to write content and just run it through this checklist?**

AI-generated content lacks original insights, firsthand experience, and unique examples—signals Google uses to assess E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness). Use AI for research and outlining, but write the final draft yourself or heavily rewrite AI output with proprietary knowledge.

**What's the minimum word count for SEO?**

No universal minimum, but most competitive queries require 1,500-2,500 words to rank. Check top-ranking competitors—your article should match or exceed their depth. Don't add fluff to hit word count. If you can comprehensively cover the topic in 1,200 words, do that.

**How often should I update articles after publishing?**

Quarterly for top-performing content (pages generating 500+ monthly sessions). Annually for evergreen content. Add new statistics, examples, or sections. Update the publish date. Rankings typically improve within 2-4 weeks post-refresh.

This checklist isn't bureaucracy—it's the difference between content that ranks and content that doesn't. Writers who optimize during drafting, not after, produce publish-ready content that ranks faster and requires fewer revisions.

Run through these 22 checks before every submission. After 10-15 articles, they become instinctive. You'll write with SEO structure integrated from the first sentence, not as a post-draft cleanup task.
