# The SEO Responsibility Matrix—Who Owns What in Cross-Functional Teams

SEO projects die in organizations where ownership is unclear. Not because people refuse to do the work. Because nobody knows whose work it is.

## Why SEO Projects Stall in Organizations with Shared Ownership

### Accountability Diffusion Kills Execution

When a task has no owner, the task does not have a deadline. It has a hope.

### When Everyone Owns SEO, No One Owns SEO

Declaring SEO important without assigning SEO responsibility creates the appearance of commitment while guaranteeing inaction.

### Role Confusion Between Content, Product, and Dev

Four reasonable positions. No resolution mechanism. The project dies in committee.

## Breaking Down SEO Ownership by Role

### What Executives Should Own

Budget allocation, vendor selection, strategic direction.

### What Product Managers Should Own

Roadmap prioritization, feature scoping, cross-functional coordination.

### What Developers Should Own

Technical implementation, performance optimization, crawlability architecture.

### What Content Teams Should Own

On-page optimization, content production, content maintenance.

### What Marketing Managers Should Own

Reporting, channel integration, vendor management.

## Using RACI to Clarify SEO Accountability

### Responsible vs Accountable vs Consulted vs Informed

One accountable owner per task. Limit Consulted to people whose input materially changes the outcome.

### Mapping SEO Tasks to the RACI Framework

Every task gets a single accountable owner, clear responsible parties, and minimal consultation overhead.

## SEO Responsibility in Different Company Structures

### Startup: Founder Plus Freelancer

Accountability concentrates on the founder with freelancer execution.

### Mid-Size: Marketing Manager Plus Agency Plus Dev Team

Clear scope definitions and shared KPIs prevent accountability diffusion.

### Enterprise: SEO Manager Plus Product Plus Engineering Plus Content

Governance, escalation paths, and executive sponsorship required.
