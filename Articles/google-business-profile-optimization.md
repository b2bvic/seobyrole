# Google Business Profile Optimization: The Local SEO Checklist for Service Businesses

**Google Business Profile** (formerly Google My Business) controls local search visibility. If you're not in the Map Pack—the top 3 local results with map pins—you're invisible to 70% of local searchers.

Most service businesses claim their profile and abandon it. They don't optimize categories, ignore review requests, and upload one photo. Then they wonder why competitors rank higher.

This guide builds the complete optimization framework: profile setup, category selection, review generation, post scheduling, Q&A management, and the signals that push profiles into the Map Pack.

## Why Google Business Profile Matters More Than Your Website

**Local search intent is hyper-transactional.** People searching "plumber near me" or "Italian restaurant open now" want immediate results. They're not reading blog posts—they're calling businesses or visiting stores.

### The Local Search Funnel

1. User searches "roof repair [city]"
2. Google shows Map Pack (3 local businesses) + local organic results
3. User clicks business in Map Pack, views profile (photos, reviews, hours, services)
4. User calls directly from search results (70% of mobile local searches result in a call within 24 hours)

**Your website plays a secondary role.** If your **Google Business Profile** is weak, users never reach your site.

### Ranking Factors for Map Pack Visibility

Google ranks local businesses based on:

1. **Relevance:** How well your profile matches the search query (category selection, keywords in business name/description)
2. **Distance:** Physical proximity to searcher (can't control this, but can optimize for service area)
3. **Prominence:** Review quantity/quality, website authority, citation consistency, user engagement

**You control 2 out of 3.** Optimization focuses on maximizing relevance and prominence.

## Step 1: Profile Setup and Verification

### Claim Your Profile

1. Go to [business.google.com](https://business.google.com)
2. Search for your business name
3. If it exists: **Claim this business**
4. If it doesn't exist: **Add your business**

**Verification methods:**
- **Postcard** (most common): Google mails a verification code to your business address (5-14 days)
- **Phone call** (some businesses): Automated call with verification code
- **Email** (rare): Verification link sent to registered email
- **Video verification** (for service-area businesses without physical locations)

**Note:** Verification is required to edit your profile or appear in local search results. Complete this first.

### Business Name Optimization

**Rule:** Use your legal business name exactly as it appears on your signage, website, and licenses.

**Don't keyword-stuff:**
❌ "Joe's Plumbing - Emergency Plumber 24/7 [City]"
✅ "Joe's Plumbing"

**Why:** Google penalizes keyword-stuffed business names. You can include descriptive keywords only if they're part of your legal name.

**Exception:** If you're a solo service provider and commonly known as "Jane Smith, Real Estate Agent," you can use that as your business name.

### Categories: The Most Important Ranking Signal

**Primary category** determines which searches you appear for. **Additional categories** expand visibility.

**How to choose:**

1. Search your service + city (e.g., "roofing contractor Austin")
2. Check top 3 Map Pack results
3. Click their profiles → see their categories (visible to public)
4. Use the same primary category as top competitors

**Primary category examples:**
- Roofing contractor (not "Contractor" or "Construction company")
- Plumber (not "Plumbing supply store")
- Real estate agent (not "Real estate agency" unless you manage a team)

**Additional categories (add 5-10):**
- Add related services you offer (Emergency plumber, Water heater repair, Drain cleaning)
- Don't add unrelated categories (confuses Google and dilutes relevance)

**Where to find full category list:**
Google doesn't publish a complete list. Use the autocomplete suggestions in the category field or reference **Pleper's GBP category list** (community-maintained spreadsheet).

### Business Description (750 Characters)

**What to include:**
- What you do (services offered)
- Who you serve (target customer or location)
- What makes you different (years in business, certifications, guarantees)
- Call to action

**Example (Roofing Contractor):**

"ABC Roofing has served Austin homeowners for 15 years, specializing in residential roof replacement, repair, and storm damage restoration. We're GAF Master Elite certified and offer a 10-year labor warranty on all installations. Our team responds to emergency calls within 2 hours. Call today for a free inspection."

**Keyword placement:** Naturally include 2-3 primary keywords (roof replacement, roof repair, storm damage).

**What NOT to do:**
- Keyword stuffing ("roof, roofing, roofer, roofing company, roof repair...")
- HTML or special characters
- Links or promotional language ("Best roofing company in Austin!")

### Service Area (For Businesses That Travel to Customers)

If you don't have a walk-in location (plumbers, electricians, mobile services):

1. Hide your address (check "I deliver goods and services to my customers")
2. Define service areas (add cities or ZIP codes you serve)
3. Set radius (optional: "Serves within 25 miles of [city]")

**Why this matters:** Google won't show your business to searchers outside your service area.

### Hours of Operation

**Set accurate hours, including:**
- Regular hours (Monday-Sunday)
- Holiday hours (Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's)
- Special hours (if you offer after-hours emergency service, add "Open 24 hours" or note in description)

**Update holidays manually.** Google doesn't auto-adjust. Customers arriving at closed businesses leave negative reviews.

### Attributes (Special Features)

**Select all applicable:**
- Wheelchair accessible entrance
- Free Wi-Fi
- Outdoor seating (restaurants)
- Women-led business
- Veteran-led business
- LGBTQ+ friendly
- Online appointments
- On-site services

**Why this matters:** Users filter by attributes ("plumber open now," "restaurant outdoor seating"). Missing attributes = missed visibility.

## Step 2: Photos and Visual Content

**Profiles with photos get 42% more direction requests and 35% more website clicks than profiles without.**

### Photo Requirements

**Minimum:**
- 3 exterior photos (storefront, entrance, parking)
- 3 interior photos (workspace, office, showroom)
- 3 team photos (staff, owner, technicians)
- 5 service photos (work in progress, completed projects)

**Optimal:**
- 20-30 photos across categories
- Updated quarterly (shows active business)

**Technical specs:**
- Format: JPG or PNG
- Size: 10KB - 5MB
- Resolution: 720px × 720px minimum (higher is better)
- Aspect ratio: Square or 4:3 recommended

### Photo Categories

1. **Cover photo:** Your most visually compelling image (auto-selected by Google, but you can suggest via profile editor)
2. **Logo:** Square logo on white or transparent background
3. **Exterior:** Building facade, signage, parking
4. **Interior:** Office, showroom, waiting area
5. **Team:** Staff photos (name tags visible), team at work
6. **Products/Services:** Before/after shots, completed work, service trucks
7. **Food & Drink (restaurants):** Menu items, plated dishes, bar

**Pro tip:** User-uploaded photos (from customers) carry more weight than business-uploaded photos. Encourage customers to share photos in reviews.

## Step 3: Review Generation and Management

**Reviews are the #1 prominence signal.** More reviews + higher average rating = higher Map Pack rankings.

### Review Generation Strategy

**Goal:** 2-5 new reviews per month (consistent flow beats sporadic bursts).

**How to ask:**

**Method 1: Direct link**
1. Go to your **Google Business Profile** dashboard
2. Click "Get more reviews"
3. Copy short URL (e.g., g.page/your-business/review)
4. Send to customers via email, text, or QR code

**Method 2: Email template**

Subject: How was your experience with [Business Name]?

"Hi [Customer],

Thank you for choosing [Business Name] for your [service]. We'd love to hear about your experience. Would you mind leaving a quick review on Google? It helps other customers find us.

[Review link]

Thanks again,
[Your Name]"

**Method 3: In-person request**

"If you were happy with our service, we'd appreciate a Google review. Here's a card with the link—it takes 60 seconds."

**Timing:** Ask within 24-48 hours of service completion (while experience is fresh).

### Responding to Reviews

**Respond to ALL reviews (positive and negative) within 24-48 hours.**

**Positive review response template:**

"Thank you, [Reviewer Name]! We're thrilled you had a great experience with [specific detail they mentioned]. We look forward to working with you again."

**Negative review response framework:**

1. **Acknowledge:** "Thank you for sharing your feedback, [Name]."
2. **Apologize (if warranted):** "We're sorry we didn't meet your expectations."
3. **Explain (briefly, no excuses):** "We experienced [brief context]."
4. **Offer resolution:** "We'd like to make this right. Please contact us at [phone/email]."
5. **Take it offline:** Don't argue publicly.

**Example:**

"Thank you for your feedback, Sarah. We're sorry the technician arrived later than scheduled. We had an emergency call that delayed our route. We'd like to offer a discount on your next service to make this right. Please call us at (555) 123-4567."

**Why this matters:** Google tracks response rate and speed. Businesses that respond to reviews rank higher.

### Handling Fake or Malicious Reviews

**If a review violates Google's policies:**

1. Click the three dots next to the review
2. Select "Report review"
3. Choose reason (spam, fake, conflict of interest, off-topic)

**Google only removes reviews that violate policies (spam, fake, profanity, personal attacks).** They don't remove negative reviews just because you disagree.

**If Google won't remove it:**
- Respond professionally (your response shows prospective customers how you handle conflict)
- Flag it as "not recommended" (some review management tools allow this)
- Bury it with new positive reviews

## Step 4: Google Posts (Weekly Updates)

**Google Posts** appear in your profile and increase engagement. Profiles that post weekly rank higher.

### Post Types

1. **What's New:** General updates, announcements
2. **Events:** Upcoming sales, open houses, workshops
3. **Offers:** Discounts, promotions (require promo code or expiration date)
4. **Products:** Showcase specific services or products

### Post Structure

**Title:** 58 characters max (appears in search results)
**Description:** 1,500 characters max (keep to 100-200 words)
**Photo:** Required, 400px × 300px minimum
**CTA button:** Learn More, Call Now, Book, Sign Up, Buy

**Example (Roofing Contractor):**

**Title:** "Free Roof Inspections This Month"
**Description:** "Storm season is here. Schedule a free roof inspection to identify damage early and avoid costly repairs. We'll check shingles, flashing, and gutters—no obligation."
**Photo:** Technician inspecting roof
**CTA:** Call Now

**Posting frequency:** 1-2 times per week minimum.

**Pro tip:** Posts expire after 7 days (except Events, which last until event date). Treat this like social media—regular updates signal active business.

## Step 5: Questions & Answers

**The Q&A section** appears below reviews. Users can ask questions publicly, and anyone (including competitors) can answer.

**Why this matters:** Unanswered questions or competitor answers hurt credibility.

### Proactive Q&A Seeding

**Ask and answer your own questions:**

**Common questions to seed:**
- "Do you offer emergency services?"
- "What areas do you serve?"
- "Are you licensed and insured?"
- "Do you offer free estimates?"
- "What payment methods do you accept?"

**How to seed:**

1. Open an incognito browser (or ask a friend)
2. Ask the question on your profile
3. Answer from your business account

**This populates Q&A with helpful information and prevents competitors or trolls from answering.**

### Monitoring Q&A

**Check your Q&A section weekly.** Respond to new questions within 24 hours.

**If a competitor leaves a misleading answer:**
- Upvote/downvote doesn't exist, so flag inappropriate answers via "Report" button
- Add your own answer to provide accurate information

## Step 6: Website and NAP Consistency

**NAP = Name, Address, Phone Number**

**Rule:** Your business name, address, and phone number must be **identical** across:
- **Google Business Profile**
- Your website
- Local directories (**Yelp**, **Yellow Pages**, **Better Business Bureau**)
- Social media profiles (Facebook, LinkedIn)

**Why:** Google cross-references citations. Inconsistent NAP signals low trustworthiness and hurts rankings.

**Common inconsistencies:**
- "ABC Roofing LLC" on website, "ABC Roofing" on Google
- "123 Main St" on Google, "123 Main Street Suite A" on website
- Different phone numbers (office line vs. mobile)

**Fix this:** Audit all citations using **Moz Local**, **BrightLocal**, or manually via Google search "[your business name] + [city]."

## Step 7: Map Pack Ranking Optimization

**To break into the top 3 Map Pack:**

### 1. Maximize Review Volume and Quality

**Target:** 50+ reviews with 4.5+ star average.

**Competitors with 200+ reviews are tough to outrank, but you can compete locally by:**
- Generating reviews faster (2-5 per month)
- Maintaining higher recency (reviews in the last 30 days count more)

### 2. Optimize for "Near Me" Searches

**"Near me" searches rely heavily on proximity.** If your business is far from the city center, you can still rank by:
- Setting accurate service area
- Including neighborhood/suburb names in description ("Serving North Austin, Cedar Park, and Round Rock")

### 3. Build Local Citations

**Citations = mentions of your business name, address, phone number on other websites.**

**Where to build citations:**
- **Yelp** (most important after Google)
- **Facebook Business Page**
- **Better Business Bureau**
- **Yellow Pages**
- **Angi** (formerly Angie's List) for home services
- **Healthgrades** for medical practices
- Industry-specific directories (**Avvo** for lawyers, **Zillow** for real estate)

**Rule:** Only build citations on reputable sites. Spammy directories hurt more than they help.

### 4. Earn Local Backlinks

**Backlinks to your website increase prominence.**

**Local link-building tactics:**
- Sponsor local events or nonprofits (get listed on their website)
- Guest post on local news sites or blogs
- Partner with complementary local businesses (cross-link)
- Get featured in "Best [Service] in [City]" roundups

### 5. Engage with Profile Features

**Google tracks engagement:**
- Clicks to website
- Clicks to call
- Direction requests
- Photo views

**Businesses with higher engagement rank higher.** Drive engagement by:
- Posting weekly updates (encourages profile visits)
- Uploading fresh photos (users browse photo galleries)
- Running promotions (Google Posts with offers get higher CTR)

## Common Mistakes That Kill Local Rankings

**Mistake 1: Inconsistent business hours**
Customers arrive during listed hours to find the business closed → negative reviews → lower rankings.

**Mistake 2: Ignoring reviews**
Unanswered reviews signal inactivity. Response rate and speed are ranking factors.

**Mistake 3: Using a PO Box address**
Google requires physical addresses (or service area if no physical location). PO Boxes don't qualify.

**Mistake 4: Keyword-stuffed business name**
"Joe's Plumbing - Emergency Plumber Near Me Open 24/7 [City]" triggers penalties. Use legal business name only.

**Mistake 5: Duplicate profiles**
Multiple profiles for the same business (different addresses, same phone) confuse Google and dilute rankings. Merge duplicates via Google support.

## Measuring Success: Key Metrics

**In Google Business Profile Insights:**

1. **Views:** How many people saw your profile in search or maps
2. **Actions:** Clicks to website, calls, direction requests
3. **Discovery:** How users found you (direct search vs. discovery search vs. maps)
4. **Phone calls:** Number of calls from profile (tracked automatically)
5. **Direction requests:** Users clicked "Get Directions"

**Benchmarks:**
- **Good:** 500-1,000 monthly views for small service businesses
- **Great:** 1,000-5,000 monthly views for competitive markets
- **Conversion rate:** 5-10% of views should result in actions (calls, directions, website clicks)

**Track weekly or monthly.** Sudden drops indicate ranking loss or profile issues.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I have multiple Google Business Profiles for one business?**

Only if you have multiple physical locations. Service-area businesses with one location can't create multiple profiles for different cities.

**How long does it take to rank in the Map Pack?**

3-6 months for moderately competitive markets. Highly competitive markets (lawyers, real estate, dentists) may take 6-12 months.

**Do I need a website to rank on Google Business Profile?**

No, but it helps. Profiles with websites rank higher because Google can verify business legitimacy and gather additional signals (backlinks, content).

**Can I remove negative reviews?**

Only if they violate Google's policies (spam, fake, profanity). You can't remove legitimate negative reviews. Respond professionally and bury them with new positive reviews.

**What if my business isn't showing up in search at all?**

Check: (1) Profile is verified, (2) Business name/address/phone match website exactly, (3) You've selected correct categories, (4) You're searching from within your service area.

**Google Business Profile** isn't a "set it and forget it" tool—it's a living asset that requires weekly maintenance. Businesses that treat it like a dynamic marketing channel dominate local search. Businesses that ignore it stay invisible.
