# How to Hire Your First SEO Employee

Your first SEO hire is the most consequential SEO decision you will make. The right person builds a compounding organic growth engine. The wrong person burns 12-18 months of budget and opportunity cost while producing little measurable result.

The challenge for executives making this hire is that most have never evaluated SEO talent. You cannot interview for skills you do not understand. And the SEO talent market is noisy — credentials are unreliable, experience claims are unverifiable, and the gap between a mediocre SEO practitioner and an excellent one is invisible during an interview.

This guide structures the hiring process for executives who need to make a high-quality SEO hire without being SEO experts themselves.

## Defining the Role Before You Source Candidates

### What You Actually Need (Not What Job Boards Say)

Generic "SEO Specialist" job descriptions attract generic candidates. Before sourcing, answer three questions:

**What is the primary business outcome this person will drive?** If it is organic traffic growth, the role emphasizes content strategy and keyword research. If it is technical SEO performance, the role emphasizes engineering collaboration and site architecture. If it is strategic oversight of an agency, the role emphasizes vendor management and cross-functional communication.

**Who will this person collaborate with daily?** If they sit between marketing and engineering, the role requires both technical literacy and business communication skills. If they primarily work within the marketing team, content and analytics skills take priority.

**What does the existing SEO infrastructure look like?** If you are starting from zero, you need a generalist who can build the program from foundation. If you have an established content library and technical infrastructure, you need a specialist who can optimize existing assets.

### Generalist vs Specialist

Your first SEO hire should almost always be a generalist. Generalists understand the full SEO landscape — technical, content, link building, analytics — and can build a program across all dimensions. Specialists produce depth in one area but leave gaps in others.

The exception: companies with a specific, acute SEO problem. If your JavaScript-heavy SPA is invisible to **Google** and that is the primary barrier to organic growth, your first hire should be a technical SEO specialist who can solve the rendering problem. But this is the exception, not the default.

A strong SEO generalist can later hire specialists to complement their strengths. A specialist hired first builds depth in their area while other critical SEO dimensions remain unaddressed.

### Title and Level

Calibrate the title to the scope of authority the role requires:

**SEO Manager ($80,000-$120,000):** Executes SEO strategy, manages day-to-day operations, reports to a marketing director. Appropriate when SEO is one of several marketing channels and the hire will not need VP-level stakeholder access.

**Senior SEO Manager ($100,000-$140,000):** Same execution scope but with more strategic autonomy. Appropriate when the hire will define strategy with limited oversight.

**SEO Director ($120,000-$180,000):** Owns the organic channel end-to-end. Sets strategy, manages budget, directs agencies or contractors, presents to executive leadership. Appropriate when SEO is a primary growth channel and the hire needs authority to influence engineering and product roadmaps.

**Head of SEO ($140,000-$200,000+):** Executive-level ownership of organic as a business function. Appropriate for companies where organic represents a significant revenue percentage and the hire will build and lead a team.

Under-leveling the role is a common mistake. Hiring an SEO Manager when the role requires strategic authority and executive communication produces frustration on both sides — the hire lacks organizational authority to execute their strategy, and leadership wonders why organic results are not materializing.

## Sourcing Candidates

### Where to Find Qualified SEO Talent

**LinkedIn** remains the primary sourcing channel for SEO roles. Search for candidates with current titles including "SEO," "Organic Growth," or "Search" at companies with strong organic performance in your industry.

**SEO industry communities** surface candidates who are actively engaged with the discipline. **Women in Tech SEO**, **SEO Twitter/X**, **Traffic Think Tank**, and **Superpath** (for content-focused SEO) are active communities where experienced practitioners participate.

**Conference speakers** at events like **BrightonSEO**, **MozCon**, **SearchLove**, and **SMX** demonstrate expertise through public teaching. Speakers are typically mid-to-senior practitioners with demonstrated communication skills.

**Agency alumni** — people who worked at reputable SEO agencies (**Distilled/Brainlabs**, **Siege Media**, **iPullRank**, **Seer Interactive**) and are looking to move in-house — often make excellent first hires because agency experience builds breadth across multiple industries and SEO disciplines.

### Evaluating Resumes Without SEO Knowledge

You cannot evaluate SEO expertise directly. But you can evaluate proxies:

**Outcome descriptions, not activity descriptions.** "Grew organic traffic from 50,000 to 200,000 monthly sessions within 18 months" demonstrates impact. "Managed SEO strategy and conducted keyword research" describes activities without outcomes.

**Tenure at recognizable companies.** Not because brand names guarantee quality, but because companies with significant organic programs (**HubSpot**, **Zapier**, **NerdWallet**, **Wirecutter**) have rigorous SEO teams that develop strong practitioners.

**Portfolio or case studies.** Candidates who can show specific examples of SEO projects with measurable results demonstrate the ability to execute and measure — the two skills that matter most.

**Content production.** Does the candidate write about SEO? Blog posts, conference talks, newsletter content, and social media threads about SEO practice indicate someone who thinks deeply about the discipline and communicates effectively.

## The Interview Process

### Round 1: Culture and Communication (Hiring Manager)

Evaluate whether the candidate can communicate SEO concepts to non-SEO stakeholders. This is the most important skill for a first SEO hire because they will need to secure resources from engineering, justify budgets to leadership, and coordinate with content and marketing teams.

**Ask:** "Explain to me, as someone who does not understand SEO, what you would do in the first 90 days of this role and why those activities would produce business results."

The quality of the explanation reveals communication skill. Candidates who default to jargon will struggle cross-functionally. Candidates who translate SEO into business outcomes will thrive.

**Ask:** "Tell me about a time when an engineering team or leadership group rejected an SEO recommendation. What happened, and how did you handle it?"

This reveals political navigation ability. First SEO hires face organizational resistance. The candidate's response shows whether they can persist productively or whether they capitulate or escalate unproductively.

### Round 2: Technical Assessment (With an External Evaluator)

If you lack internal SEO expertise to evaluate technical skill, hire an external SEO consultant to conduct a 60-minute technical interview. Budget $500-$1,000 for this service. The consultant evaluates the candidate's depth across technical SEO, content strategy, and analytics.

Alternatively, use a practical assessment. Provide the candidate with access to your **Google Search Console** and **Google Analytics** data (sanitized if necessary). Ask them to produce a written assessment: what are the top 3 organic growth opportunities and what specific actions would address each?

Evaluate the assessment for specificity, data interpretation quality, and strategic coherence. If the candidate identifies opportunities that align with known business priorities and proposes concrete actions with measurable outcomes, they demonstrate the analytical and strategic skills the role requires.

Refer to the [SEO interview questions guide](/articles/seo-interview-questions-hiring-managers.html) for specific questions organized by competency area.

### Round 3: Cross-Functional Fit (Engineering and Content Leads)

Include an engineering lead and a content lead in the interview process. Each evaluates whether the candidate can collaborate effectively with their function.

The engineering lead assesses: Can this person write clear technical requirements? Do they understand the constraints of our tech stack? Will they propose reasonable requests or create friction?

The content lead assesses: Does this person understand editorial quality? Can they provide keyword and structure guidance without micromanaging creative output? Will they improve or hinder the content production process?

Both interviews evaluate collaboration potential, not SEO skill. Cross-functional fit determines whether the first SEO hire integrates into the organization or operates in isolation.

## Onboarding the First SEO Hire

### The First 30 Days: Audit and Listen

The new hire should spend the first month absorbing — not executing. They audit the current organic landscape: technical health, content inventory, competitive positioning, analytics infrastructure, and existing processes.

They should meet with stakeholders across engineering, product, content, and leadership to understand priorities, constraints, and past SEO history. This discovery period prevents the common mistake of new SEO hires launching initiatives that conflict with organizational context they have not yet absorbed.

**Deliverable at day 30:** A written assessment of current organic performance, the top 5 opportunities, and a proposed 90-day action plan.

### Days 30-60: Foundation

Execute foundational work that produces early signal without requiring significant cross-functional resources. Technical audit fixes, content optimization of existing high-traffic pages, analytics configuration improvements.

These early actions demonstrate competence to stakeholders while the hire builds the relationships needed for larger initiatives.

### Days 60-90: Strategy Presentation

Present the organic growth strategy to leadership. This should include [SEO forecasting](/articles/seo-forecasting-executive-scrutiny.html) tied to business outcomes, resource requirements, cross-functional dependencies, and a 12-month milestone timeline.

This presentation is the hire's first opportunity to establish SEO as a strategic business function rather than a tactical marketing activity. The quality of this presentation often determines the level of organizational support the SEO program receives going forward.

## Compensation and Retention

### Market Rate Factors

SEO compensation varies by geography, industry, company stage, and role scope:

- **Geography:** Major tech hubs (SF, NYC, Seattle, Austin) command 20-40% premiums over national averages
- **Industry:** SaaS, fintech, and e-commerce pay above average. Agencies, publishers, and nonprofits pay below
- **Company stage:** Late-stage startups and mid-market companies typically offer the best total compensation (salary + equity). Enterprise companies offer stability and benefits but may cap base salary
- **Remote flexibility:** Remote roles attract wider candidate pools and can reduce salary requirements by 10-20% for candidates outside high-cost markets

### Retention Signals

Your first SEO hire is at highest retention risk in months 12-18. By then, they have built the program, proven results, and attracted external recruiter attention. Retention strategies:

**Growth path clarity.** Show the hire what the role becomes as the program succeeds — team leadership, expanded scope, or strategic advisory. Ambiguity about growth drives departures.

**Budget authority.** Grant budget for tools, contractors, and content production. SEO practitioners who lack resources to execute their strategy burn out from organizational friction.

**Executive visibility.** Ensure the hire has regular access to leadership. SEO people who feel invisible within the organization seek visibility elsewhere.

**Competitive compensation review at 12 months.** The SEO talent market moves fast. If the hire has demonstrated results, proactively adjust compensation before they start interviewing.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Should I hire someone from an agency or from an in-house role?

Both backgrounds have advantages. Agency alumni bring breadth of experience across multiple industries and fast-paced execution skills. In-house alumni bring depth of experience within a single business model and cross-functional collaboration skills. For a first SEO hire, agency backgrounds often provide better breadth. For a senior strategic hire, in-house backgrounds often provide better organizational navigation.

### How long should the hiring process take?

Expect 6-8 weeks from job posting to offer acceptance. SEO talent in competitive markets takes longer — budget 8-12 weeks. Rushing the process to fill the role faster typically results in settling for a weaker candidate, which costs far more in delayed results than the additional weeks of searching.

### What if the hire does not work out?

Evaluate at the 90-day mark against the deliverables framework above. If the written assessment and strategy presentation are weak, have a direct conversation about expectations and provide 60 days for improvement. If improvement does not materialize by month 6, begin replacement planning. The cost of retaining a poor SEO hire for 12+ months is significant — both in direct salary and in the opportunity cost of stalled organic growth.

### Can I hire a junior SEO person and train them?

Only if you have an experienced SEO mentor available internally or through an advisory arrangement. Junior SEO practitioners without senior guidance develop bad habits, pursue ineffective strategies, and lack the judgment to prioritize effectively. If you can provide mentorship, a junior hire at $50,000-$70,000 with 12-18 months of development can become a strong practitioner. Without mentorship, you are paying for someone to learn through trial and error on your business.

### Should I require SEO certifications?

Certifications from **Google** (Google Analytics, Google Ads) demonstrate willingness to learn platforms but do not indicate SEO expertise. SEO-specific certifications from **SEMrush**, **HubSpot**, and others vary in rigor. No certification substitutes for demonstrated results. Evaluate portfolio and outcomes over credentials.
