# SEO for Marketing Managers—Channel Integration Beyond Posting Everywhere

"Integrated marketing" sounds strategic until you look at what it means in practice. Most companies define it as repurposing the same content across every channel. That's not integration. That's distribution.

Real integrated marketing strategy means each channel contributes something the others cannot.

## Why "Integrated Marketing" Usually Means "Post the Same Thing Everywhere"

### Channel Strengths Get Ignored When You Repurpose Blindly

SEO content wins through depth. Social wins through provocation. Email wins through segmentation.

### SEO Content Doesn't Perform on Social (and Vice Versa)

These metrics rarely correlate. The mistake is expecting content designed for one context to perform in another.

## How SEO and Paid Search Should Work Together

### Using Paid Data to Validate SEO Keyword Targets

A $500 ad spend over two weeks generates data that saves $10,000 in wasted content production.

### SERP Dominance Strategy

For high-value keywords, own paid, organic, and featured snippet positions simultaneously.

## Attribution Models That Actually Credit SEO

### Why Last-Click Attribution Kills SEO Investment

Last-click attribution makes SEO look inefficient compared to channels that appear at the end of journeys.

### Multi-Touch Models That Show SEO's Assist Role

Linear, time-decay, and position-based attribution all give SEO more accurate credit.

### Brand Search Lift as a Proxy

Track branded search volume over time. Correlate it with SEO content publication.

## Email + SEO—Content Distribution That Compounds

### Using Email Engagement to Predict SEO Content Performance

Email becomes a content testing channel. The fastest way to learn what resonates.

## Managing SEO Vendors Alongside Other Agencies

### Preventing SEO-Paid Conflict Over Budget and Credit

Define attribution rules before agencies argue about credit.

### Reporting SEO Results to Executives Who Prioritize Paid

Frame SEO as cost reduction, not just revenue generation.

## Career Pathing

### When to Double Down on SEO Expertise vs Broadening Skills

The market rewards depth. Generalists who "know some SEO" compete with specialists.

### Building a Portfolio That Proves SEO Contribution to Revenue

Document attribution methodology. Show business impact, not vanity metrics.
