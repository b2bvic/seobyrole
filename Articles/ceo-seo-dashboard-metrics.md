# SEO Metrics Every CEO Should Track Monthly

You do not need to understand SEO to evaluate whether it is working. You need five numbers on a dashboard, the discipline to read them monthly, and the context to know what each one means for revenue.

Most CEOs receive SEO reports that are either too granular (keyword-level ranking data for thousands of terms) or too vague ("traffic is up, things look good"). Neither format helps you make decisions. The first drowns you in tactical noise. The second provides no actionable signal.

The metrics that matter for a CEO fit on a single page. They answer three questions: Is organic traffic growing? Is that traffic converting? Are we spending the right amount relative to what organic delivers?

Everything else is execution detail your SEO team or agency should handle without your involvement.

## The Five Metrics That Belong on Your Dashboard

### 1. Organic Revenue (or Organic-Attributed Pipeline)

This is the number that matters most. Not traffic. Not rankings. Revenue.

For e-commerce companies, **Google Analytics 4** tracks revenue from organic sessions directly. For B2B companies, the equivalent is pipeline value attributed to organic traffic — leads that entered through organic search and progressed to opportunity stage in your CRM.

If your team cannot produce this number, that itself is a finding. It means your attribution infrastructure needs work before any SEO investment decision has real grounding.

The trend matters more than the absolute number. Organic revenue growing 15% quarter-over-quarter tells you the SEO program is compounding. Flat organic revenue despite increased SEO spend tells you something is broken.

**What to ask your team:** "What revenue did organic search generate last month, and how does that compare to the same month last year?"

### 2. Non-Branded Organic Traffic

Total organic traffic is misleading because it includes people searching your company name. Branded searches — people typing "Acme Corp" into **Google** — reflect brand awareness, not SEO performance. Those visitors would find you regardless of SEO investment.

Non-branded organic traffic isolates the visitors who found you through generic searches: "project management software," "best CRM for small business," "how to reduce churn." These are the visitors your SEO program is actually acquiring.

**Google Search Console** separates branded from non-branded queries. Your team should filter out any query containing your brand name and report the remainder.

A healthy SEO program shows non-branded traffic growing faster than branded traffic. If branded traffic is growing but non-branded is flat, your SEO program is underperforming while your brand marketing is carrying the weight.

**What to ask your team:** "What percentage of our organic traffic comes from non-branded searches, and is that number growing?"

### 3. Organic Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

Calculate this the same way you calculate paid CAC: total SEO spend divided by customers acquired through organic.

SEO spend includes agency fees, in-house SEO salaries, content production costs, and any tools purchased specifically for SEO. Customers acquired through organic are those whose first meaningful touch was an organic search visit, tracked through your attribution model.

The power of this metric is in comparison. When your organic CAC is $45 and your paid CAC is $180, the business case for SEO investment becomes self-evident. When organic CAC starts climbing toward paid CAC, something needs investigation.

Most CEOs discover that organic CAC is 60-80% lower than paid CAC once the SEO program reaches maturity. The catch is that SEO requires 12-18 months of investment before CAC numbers stabilize. Early-stage SEO programs show high CAC because the spend is front-loaded while traffic compounds slowly.

**What to ask your team:** "What is our cost to acquire a customer through organic versus paid channels?"

### 4. Share of Voice (Organic Visibility)

Share of voice measures how visible your site is in search results compared to competitors for a defined set of keywords that matter to your business.

Tools like **Ahrefs**, **SEMrush**, and **Sistrix** calculate this by tracking rankings across your target keyword set and computing what percentage of available clicks your site captures versus competitors.

If your share of voice is 12% and your top competitor holds 28%, that gap represents the organic traffic delta between you. As share of voice grows, traffic and revenue follow proportionally.

This metric is particularly useful for CEO-level decision-making because it is competitive. You can evaluate whether your SEO investment is gaining or losing ground relative to specific competitors — the same framing you apply to market share in every other dimension of the business.

**What to ask your team:** "What is our organic share of voice versus our top three competitors, and is the gap closing?"

### 5. Organic Conversion Rate

Organic traffic that does not convert is a vanity metric. Conversion rate tells you whether the traffic SEO delivers is actually useful to the business.

Measure this in **Google Analytics 4** by filtering to organic traffic and tracking conversion events: demo requests, signups, purchases, contact form submissions — whatever your business defines as a conversion.

Healthy organic conversion rates typically range from 2-5% for B2B and 1-3% for e-commerce, though this varies significantly by industry and funnel stage. The trend matters more than the benchmark. Declining conversion rate on growing traffic suggests SEO is attracting the wrong audience — high volume but low intent.

**What to ask your team:** "What percentage of organic visitors convert, and how has that changed over the last six months?"

## Metrics CEOs Should Ignore

### Individual Keyword Rankings

Your agency sends a report showing you moved from position 8 to position 5 for "enterprise resource planning." That information is meaningless in isolation. One keyword's ranking tells you nothing about overall program health.

Keyword rankings are execution metrics. They belong on your SEO team's dashboard, not yours. The aggregate impact of rankings appears in your traffic, revenue, and share of voice numbers.

### Domain Authority or Domain Rating

**Moz's** Domain Authority and **Ahrefs'** Domain Rating are third-party scores that estimate your site's ranking ability. They are useful for SEO practitioners comparing link-building progress. They are not useful for CEOs making investment decisions.

These scores do not correlate directly to revenue. A site with DA 45 can outperform a site with DA 70 for specific commercial keywords. Tracking DA monthly gives you a number that moves slowly and tells you little about business impact.

### Pages Indexed

Knowing that **Google** has indexed 4,200 of your 4,500 pages is a technical health check, not a business metric. Your SEO team should monitor this. You should not.

### Backlink Count

The total number of sites linking to you is a vanity metric at the CEO level. Quality matters exponentially more than quantity. One link from a major industry publication outweighs 500 links from irrelevant directories. Your team tracks link quality. You track the revenue those links eventually produce.

## Building the Dashboard

### Format That CEOs Actually Read

One page. Five metrics. Each metric shows the current month, the same month last year, and the trend direction (up, down, flat). Color coding: green for improving, red for declining, gray for flat.

No charts unless they show a clear trend over 12+ months. No commentary longer than two sentences per metric. No jargon. If the dashboard requires an SEO glossary to interpret, it is too complex.

### Data Sources and Ownership

Your marketing team or agency should own the dashboard and update it within the first five business days of each month. The data sources:

- **Organic revenue:** CRM + **Google Analytics 4**
- **Non-branded traffic:** **Google Search Console** (filtered)
- **Organic CAC:** Finance data (spend) + CRM (customers)
- **Share of voice:** **Ahrefs**, **SEMrush**, or **Sistrix**
- **Conversion rate:** **Google Analytics 4**

If different teams own different data sources, designate one person to compile the dashboard. Distributed ownership of CEO reporting produces inconsistency and delays.

### Monthly Review Cadence

Spend 15 minutes reviewing the SEO dashboard during your monthly marketing review. Ask the five questions listed above. If all five metrics trend favorably, SEO is working — move on to other agenda items. If any metric declines, request a one-page diagnostic from your SEO team explaining why and what they intend to do about it.

This cadence gives you oversight without operational involvement. You are evaluating outcomes, not directing tactics.

## When the Numbers Signal Problems

### Organic Revenue Flat Despite Traffic Growth

Traffic is growing but revenue is not. This means SEO is attracting visitors who do not buy. Possible causes: targeting informational keywords instead of commercial keywords, landing page experience is poor, or the traffic growth is in a market segment that does not convert.

**Action:** Ask your SEO team to segment traffic by intent (informational vs. commercial) and demonstrate that commercial keyword traffic is growing, not just total traffic.

### Non-Branded Traffic Declining

Competitors are winning the keywords your SEO program previously owned. This is the organic equivalent of losing market share.

**Action:** Request a competitive gap analysis showing which keywords you lost rankings for and which competitors gained. Evaluate whether the decline is temporary (algorithm fluctuation) or structural (competitors invested more aggressively).

### Organic CAC Rising

Your SEO program is becoming less efficient. Spending more to acquire each organic customer. This could signal content saturation (diminishing returns on additional content), increased competition, or misallocated SEO resources.

**Action:** Compare CAC trends against [SEO forecasting models](/articles/seo-forecasting-executive-scrutiny.html) to determine if the trend is temporary or structural. If structural, reevaluate resource allocation.

### Share of Voice Shrinking

You are losing organic visibility to competitors. This is a leading indicator — share of voice declines precede traffic and revenue declines by 2-4 months.

**Action:** This is the earliest warning signal. When share of voice contracts, investigate immediately rather than waiting for revenue impact. See the [agency audit guide](/articles/how-to-audit-seo-agency.html) if you suspect your SEO partner is underperforming.

## Connecting SEO Metrics to Board Communication

Your board does not want to hear about SEO. They want to hear about customer acquisition efficiency, revenue growth, and competitive positioning. SEO metrics translate directly into those conversations:

- Organic revenue growth → revenue diversification beyond paid channels
- Organic CAC vs paid CAC → capital efficiency of marketing spend
- Share of voice growth → competitive positioning in digital channels
- Non-branded traffic growth → new market capture (not just existing customer retention)

Frame SEO investment the way you frame any growth investment: here is what we spent, here is what it returned, here is how it compares to alternative uses of that capital.

The [SEO budget justification guide](/articles/seo-budget-justification-board.html) provides specific templates for translating these metrics into board-ready narratives.

## What You Do This Week

**Tomorrow morning:** Ask your marketing lead or agency for last month's organic revenue number. If they cannot produce it within 24 hours, that is your first action item — fix attribution.

**This week:** Request a one-page dashboard with the five metrics above. Specify the format: current month, year-over-year comparison, trend indicator.

**This month:** Review the dashboard. Ask the five questions. Assess whether your current SEO investment is producing returns commensurate with spend.

CEOs who track these five metrics monthly make better SEO investment decisions than CEOs who track fifty metrics quarterly. The signal-to-noise ratio matters more than the data volume. Five numbers, once a month, fifteen minutes of your time.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long before SEO metrics become meaningful after starting a program?

Expect 6-9 months before organic traffic trends become reliable indicators. Revenue attribution stabilizes around 12-18 months as the content library matures and ranking positions consolidate. During the first 6 months, focus on leading indicators like share of voice growth and indexed page count rather than revenue metrics.

### Should I track the same SEO metrics for a B2B and B2C business?

The five core metrics apply to both, but the conversion definitions differ. B2C tracks purchases and revenue per organic session. B2B tracks marketing qualified leads, pipeline value, and sales-accepted leads attributed to organic. The framework is identical; the conversion events change.

### What if my SEO agency resists providing organic revenue data?

This is a red flag. Agencies that cannot connect their work to revenue either lack the attribution infrastructure or prefer to report metrics they can more easily control (rankings, traffic). Insist on revenue attribution. If the agency cannot support it, evaluate whether your analytics setup needs upgrading or whether the agency is avoiding accountability.

### How do I benchmark our SEO metrics against industry averages?

**Ahrefs**, **SEMrush**, and **Databox** publish industry benchmark data for organic traffic, conversion rates, and competitive metrics. Your share of voice metric inherently benchmarks you against competitors. For CAC benchmarks, consult industry reports from **First Page Sage**, **HubSpot**, or **Gartner** that publish average organic acquisition costs by industry.

### Is organic traffic still growing as a channel, or is AI search reducing its value?

Organic traffic remains the largest single source of website traffic across most industries, generating over 50% of all web visits according to recent research. **Google's** AI Overviews and other AI-powered search features are changing click patterns for informational queries, but commercial and transactional queries still drive substantial organic click-through. The channel is evolving, not dying.
