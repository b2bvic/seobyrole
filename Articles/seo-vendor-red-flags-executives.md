# SEO Vendor Red Flags Every Executive Should Recognize

The SEO industry has a credibility problem. Low barriers to entry mean anyone can claim SEO expertise, and the 6-12 month results timeline gives underperforming vendors a long runway before accountability catches up.

Executives who cannot distinguish competent SEO vendors from incompetent ones lose budget, time, and competitive positioning. The losses compound because months spent with the wrong vendor are months your competitors spent with the right one.

These red flags are observable without SEO expertise. They indicate structural problems with how the vendor operates, not tactical disagreements about keyword strategy.

## Red Flag 1: Guaranteed Rankings

"We guarantee page one rankings for your target keywords."

No legitimate vendor guarantees rankings because no vendor controls **Google's** algorithm. Rankings depend on competitive dynamics, algorithm changes, and domain authority factors that no single vendor influences completely. A guarantee of rankings is either a lie or a guarantee to rank for keywords so obscure that ranking has no business value.

**What to listen for instead:** "Based on competitive analysis, here are realistic ranking targets for your keyword set within 12-18 months. Here are the assumptions underlying those targets, and here are the risks that could delay results."

Honest vendors project ranges, not guarantees. They explain assumptions and acknowledge uncertainty. This is not hedging — it is intellectual honesty about a channel with genuine variability.

## Red Flag 2: Vanity Metrics in Proposals and Reports

The vendor's proposal or monthly report emphasizes:
- Total keywords ranking on page one (without indicating which keywords or their business relevance)
- Domain Authority or Domain Rating increases (without connecting to traffic or revenue)
- Total backlinks acquired (without indicating link quality or relevance)
- Impressions growth (without connecting to clicks or conversions)

These metrics can all improve while business outcomes stagnate or decline. A vendor could rank for 500 irrelevant keywords on page one while your commercial keywords remain buried on page three.

**What to demand instead:** Revenue attributed to organic search, non-branded traffic growth, organic customer acquisition cost, and share of voice against specific competitors. Vendors that resist reporting on business outcomes typically do so because their work does not produce them.

See the [CEO dashboard metrics guide](/articles/ceo-seo-dashboard-metrics.html) for the specific metrics that indicate actual SEO performance.

## Red Flag 3: Black-Box Methodology

"Our proprietary methodology is what sets us apart. We can't share the details."

SEO is not proprietary. The techniques are well-documented. **Google** publishes guidelines for how to optimize sites. The SEO community shares strategies openly. Any vendor claiming a secret methodology is either doing legitimate work they are unnecessarily obscuring or doing questionable work they need to hide.

Proprietary tools are different from proprietary methodology. A vendor may have built custom software for reporting or analysis — that is reasonable. But the underlying strategy (content optimization, technical SEO, link building) should be explainable in specific, verifiable terms.

**What to ask:** "Walk me through exactly what your team will do in month one, month three, and month six. What specific deliverables will I receive? What tools will you use? How will you measure success?"

A competent vendor answers this in concrete detail. A vendor hiding behind methodology claims answers in generalities.

## Red Flag 4: No References in Your Industry

The vendor cannot provide client references from companies in your industry, at your scale, with similar competitive dynamics. Their case studies feature companies in unrelated markets or describe results that are not verifiable.

Industry experience matters because SEO strategy varies significantly by vertical. E-commerce SEO, SaaS SEO, local business SEO, and enterprise B2B SEO require different approaches. A vendor with deep e-commerce experience may be poorly equipped for B2B demand generation, and vice versa.

**What to request:** Three references from companies similar to yours in industry, size, and competitive environment. Ask each reference: Did the vendor meet the projections they presented during the sales process? How responsive are they when problems arise? Would you hire them again?

If the vendor cannot produce relevant references, proceed with extreme caution.

## Red Flag 5: Long-Term Contracts With Early Termination Penalties

A vendor requiring a 12-month minimum commitment with steep cancellation penalties is insuring themselves against underperformance. If the work is good, you will renew without contractual coercion. If the work is poor, the contract forces you to continue paying.

**Acceptable contract structure:** Month-to-month after an initial 3-month commitment, or a 6-month initial term with month-to-month renewal. The initial commitment is reasonable — SEO requires setup time and the vendor needs stability to build a program. Anything beyond 6 months upfront locks you in before you have enough data to evaluate performance.

Some vendors argue that 12-month contracts are necessary because SEO takes time to show results. This is true, but it does not justify contractual lock-in. A vendor confident in their work allows you to leave and expects you to stay because results warrant it.

## Red Flag 6: No Defined Deliverables or Timeline

The proposal describes general activities — "ongoing optimization," "content strategy," "link building" — without specific deliverables per month. No content production quantities. No technical audit timeline. No link acquisition targets. No milestones.

This ambiguity creates two problems. First, you cannot evaluate whether the vendor is performing because there is nothing to measure against. Second, the vendor can reallocate resources from your account to more demanding clients without you noticing until months later when results decline.

**What to require:** A specific deliverables schedule per month. Examples: "4 long-form articles published, 1 technical audit report, 10 outreach-acquired links, monthly performance report delivered by the 5th." If activities are not specified, they will not be consistent.

## Red Flag 7: Reluctance to Provide Access

The vendor creates their own **Google Analytics** property, **Google Search Console** verification, or **Google Ads** account rather than working within your existing accounts. They host content on their domains rather than yours. They control the login credentials.

This creates vendor dependency by design. If you leave, your data, content, and accounts stay with them. Legitimate vendors work within your infrastructure and provide full access transparency.

**Non-negotiable:** Your company must own all **Google** properties, analytics accounts, domain registrations, and content files. The vendor operates within your accounts using access permissions you grant and can revoke.

## Red Flag 8: No Competitive Analysis in the Proposal

A vendor who proposes strategy without analyzing your competitive landscape is guessing. SEO is fundamentally competitive — your rankings depend on what competitors do as much as what you do. Strategy without competitive context is directionally blind.

**What a good proposal includes:** Analysis of the top 3-5 organic competitors for your target keyword set. Share of voice comparison. Content gap analysis. Backlink profile comparison. Specific strategic recommendations tied to competitive findings.

A vendor who skips competitive analysis either does not understand its importance (competence issue) or does not want to invest the effort during the sales process (commitment issue). Either way, it predicts how they will approach your account after signing.

## Red Flag 9: The Pitch Focuses on Tactics, Not Outcomes

The sales presentation walks you through technical SEO fixes, content production processes, and link-building techniques. It is detailed, impressive-sounding, and entirely about what the vendor will do rather than what your business will achieve.

**Reframe every tactical claim into an outcome question:**

- "We'll optimize your site structure" → "What traffic impact will that structural optimization produce?"
- "We'll publish 8 articles per month" → "How much organic revenue will those articles generate within 12 months?"
- "We'll build 20 high-quality links per month" → "What ranking improvements will those links drive for my commercial keywords?"

Vendors who think in outcomes answer these questions with data-backed projections. Vendors who think in activities deflect to "it depends" without providing the analysis that would make the answer specific.

## Red Flag 10: High Turnover on Your Account

Your primary contact changes every 6 months. Strategy calls include different team members each time. You repeatedly re-explain your business model, competitive landscape, and priorities to new people.

High account turnover is the most damaging operational red flag because it destroys the institutional knowledge that makes SEO compound. Every personnel change resets the learning curve and delays strategic progress.

**What to establish upfront:** Who will be your primary strategist? What is their tenure at the agency? What happens if they leave? Is there a knowledge transfer protocol? How many other accounts does your strategist manage?

A strategist managing 15+ accounts cannot provide the depth of attention your program needs. Industry average is 8-12 accounts per strategist. Ask the number directly and evaluate accordingly.

## Conducting an SEO Vendor Evaluation

### The Discovery Call Checklist

Ask these questions in the initial conversation. The responses — their specificity, their honesty, their depth — reveal more than the polished proposal that follows.

1. "Walk me through a campaign that failed. What happened and what did you learn?"
2. "How do you measure success? Give me the specific metrics you track."
3. "What is your team structure? Who will do the actual work on my account?"
4. "How do you handle disagreements with clients about strategy?"
5. "What do you need from us to succeed? What does a bad client look like?"

Vendors who answer question one honestly demonstrate self-awareness. Vendors who dodge it have either never failed (unlikely) or refuse to acknowledge failure (concerning).

### Reference Check Protocol

When speaking with references, ask outcome-focused questions:

- "Has the vendor met the targets they projected during the sales process?"
- "How do they handle months where results decline?"
- "Have you ever been surprised by something they did or did not do?"
- "If you were starting over, would you hire them again?"
- "What is the single biggest weakness of working with them?"

The last question is the most revealing. Every vendor has weaknesses. References who cannot name one are either not genuine references or have not worked with the vendor long enough to encounter problems.

The [agency audit guide](/articles/how-to-audit-seo-agency.html) provides a structured framework for evaluating vendor performance once engaged.

## What Good Vendors Look Like

For contrast, here are indicators of vendor quality:

- **They ask hard questions during the sales process.** They probe your business model, competitive landscape, and past SEO history. They challenge your assumptions rather than agreeing with everything to close the deal.

- **They provide realistic timelines.** Six months to initial results. Twelve months to meaningful traffic growth. Eighteen months to revenue attribution maturity. Any vendor promising faster results for a competitive market is overpromising.

- **They show their work.** Monthly reports include specific actions taken, hours allocated, and measurable outcomes. You can verify the work was done by checking published content, reviewing technical changes, and auditing link placements.

- **They proactively identify problems.** Before you notice a traffic decline, they have already diagnosed the cause and proposed remediation. Proactive communication is the strongest indicator of account health.

- **They understand your business, not just SEO.** They can explain how their organic strategy supports your overall business objectives. They ask about revenue targets, competitive positioning, and growth plans — not just keywords and traffic goals.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many agencies should I evaluate before choosing one?

Three to five. Fewer than three limits your comparison. More than five creates decision paralysis without proportional information gain. Ensure diversity in the evaluation pool — include at least one large agency, one mid-size specialist, and one boutique or freelancer for perspective across different operating models.

### Is a cheap agency always a bad agency?

Not always, but pricing significantly below market rates indicates one of three things: the agency uses junior or offshore talent for execution, the agency oversells and under-delivers to maintain margins, or the agency is new and pricing for market entry. The third scenario can be a genuine opportunity if you verify capability through references and trial periods. The first two produce predictable underperformance.

### Can I ask an SEO agency to do a paid audit before committing to a retainer?

Yes, and you should. A paid audit ($2,000-$5,000) reveals the agency's depth of analysis, quality of recommendations, and communication style before you commit to ongoing engagement. Evaluate the audit deliverable as a sample of what ongoing work will look like. If the audit is generic and templated, the retainer work will be too.

### What should I do if I realize my current vendor is showing red flags?

Document the specific concerns. Schedule a direct conversation with the vendor's account director (not just your day-to-day contact). Present the concerns with specific examples and request a remediation plan with timeline. If remediation does not produce measurable improvement within 60-90 days, begin evaluating replacements while the current vendor continues operations. Never fire a vendor before the replacement is ready to begin — the gap period damages organic performance.

### Are SEO agencies or freelance consultants better for small businesses?

For businesses under $5M revenue, a freelance SEO consultant often provides better value than an agency. The consultant gives you direct access to senior expertise without the agency overhead (account managers, project coordinators) that inflates retainer costs. A qualified freelancer charging $3,000-$5,000/month delivers comparable strategic value to an agency charging $8,000-$12,000/month. The tradeoff is capacity — a freelancer cannot scale execution the way an agency team can.
