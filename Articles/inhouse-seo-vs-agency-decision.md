# In-House SEO Team vs Agency: Decision Framework for Executives

The question is not which option is better. The question is which option is better for your specific company at your specific stage with your specific constraints.

Companies that hire in-house too early burn runway on talent they cannot fully utilize. Companies that outsource too long build no institutional knowledge and remain perpetually dependent on vendors. Companies that try both without clear role definition get duplication, conflict, and finger-pointing when results underperform.

This decision framework maps company characteristics to the right SEO staffing model, with specific criteria for when to switch between models.

## The Three Models

### Model 1: Agency-Only

An external SEO agency handles strategy, execution, and reporting. Your company provides subject matter expertise, brand guidelines, and approval workflows. No internal SEO headcount exists.

**Best for:** Companies under $10M revenue with fewer than 100 employees. Early-stage companies that need SEO capability without the overhead of a full-time hire. Companies testing whether organic search is a viable acquisition channel before committing to in-house investment.

**Cost structure:** Monthly retainer ($3,000-$15,000/month for mid-market agencies, $15,000-$50,000/month for enterprise agencies) plus content production costs. Total annual investment typically ranges $50,000-$250,000 depending on scope.

**Advantages:** Immediate access to a full team (strategist, content producers, technical SEO, link builders). No recruiting, onboarding, or management overhead. Flexible scaling — increase or decrease scope without hiring/firing cycles. Agency brings cross-client pattern recognition from working with multiple companies.

**Disadvantages:** Agency prioritizes across a client portfolio. Your account receives a fraction of their best strategist's attention. Institutional knowledge stays with the agency, not your company. If you switch agencies, you restart the learning curve. Strategic depth on your specific business model is limited compared to an embedded team member.

### Model 2: In-House Only

A full-time SEO team handles strategy, execution, and reporting. No agency involvement. Team size ranges from a single SEO manager to a department of 5-15+ people depending on company scale.

**Best for:** Companies over $50M revenue where organic search is a primary growth channel. Companies with complex technical infrastructure requiring constant SEO attention. Companies in highly competitive organic markets where speed and integration with product/engineering teams determine outcomes.

**Cost structure:** Salary plus benefits for each team member. An SEO manager costs $80,000-$130,000 annually. An SEO director costs $120,000-$180,000. Content producers, technical SEO specialists, and link builders add $60,000-$110,000 each. A mid-size in-house team (director + 2 specialists + content producer) costs $350,000-$550,000 annually fully loaded.

**Advantages:** Full-time focus on your business. Deep institutional knowledge that compounds over years. Tight integration with product, engineering, and marketing teams. Faster execution cycles — no agency approval workflows or account management layers. Intellectual property and process knowledge stay in-house.

**Disadvantages:** Recruiting SEO talent is competitive and slow. A bad hire costs 6-12 months of lost productivity. Single points of failure — if your sole SEO person leaves, capability drops to zero overnight. In-house teams develop blind spots without external perspectives. Scaling up requires months of recruiting; scaling down means layoffs.

### Model 3: Hybrid (In-House Lead + Agency Execution)

An in-house SEO lead owns strategy, vendor management, and cross-functional integration. An agency handles execution: content production, link building, technical implementation, and reporting. The in-house lead directs the agency's work and translates between SEO and internal stakeholders.

**Best for:** Companies between $10M-$100M revenue that need strategic depth without building a full team. Companies transitioning from agency-only to in-house capability. Companies in moderately competitive organic markets where strategic integration matters but execution volume does not justify a full team.

**Cost structure:** One in-house salary ($90,000-$150,000 fully loaded) plus agency retainer ($3,000-$10,000/month). Total annual investment: $130,000-$270,000.

**Advantages:** Strategic ownership stays in-house. Institutional knowledge accumulates internally through the SEO lead. Agency provides execution scale without the overhead of a full team. The in-house lead holds the agency accountable with informed oversight — they understand what good work looks like because they do the same work.

**Disadvantages:** Requires finding a senior-level SEO hire who is both strategically capable and willing to manage vendor relationships rather than doing hands-on work. The in-house lead becomes a single point of failure. Agency management adds coordination overhead.

## The Decision Matrix

Score your company on five dimensions. Each dimension points toward one of the three models.

### Dimension 1: Revenue and Budget

| Revenue Range | Recommended Model | Reasoning |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Under $5M | Agency-only | Cannot justify full-time SEO salary. Need breadth of capability over depth. |
| $5M-$25M | Hybrid | Can afford one in-house hire. Need agency for execution scale. |
| $25M-$100M | Hybrid or In-house | Budget supports a small team. Hybrid if organic is one of many channels. In-house if organic is primary channel. |
| Over $100M | In-house (with specialist agencies) | Budget supports full team. Use agencies for specialized work (technical audits, link building) rather than full-service. |

### Dimension 2: Organic Search Dependency

How much of your revenue depends on organic search, or how much could depend on it?

If organic represents less than 10% of revenue and the growth plan does not prioritize organic significantly, an agency model provides adequate coverage without overinvestment. If organic represents 20%+ of revenue or the growth plan targets organic as a primary acquisition channel, in-house ownership becomes critical.

High organic dependency demands tight integration between SEO and product/engineering decisions. That integration is extremely difficult to achieve through an agency relationship.

### Dimension 3: Technical Complexity

Single-domain marketing websites with a CMS like **WordPress** or **Webflow** require less ongoing technical SEO work. An agency can handle periodic audits and recommendations.

Multi-domain architectures, JavaScript-heavy applications built on **React** or **Next.js**, e-commerce platforms with thousands of product pages, or SaaS platforms with user-generated content create constant technical SEO demands. These environments benefit from an in-house technical SEO specialist who participates in sprint planning and code reviews.

### Dimension 4: Competitive Intensity

In low-competition organic markets, an agency publishing consistent content can establish and maintain rankings without sophisticated strategy. In high-competition markets — SaaS, finance, insurance, legal — organic rankings require deep strategic thinking, rapid response to competitive moves, and tight coordination across content, technical, and link-building efforts. High competition favors in-house teams that can operate at speed without agency coordination overhead.

### Dimension 5: Hiring Capability

Can you recruit and retain SEO talent in your market? Companies in major tech hubs compete with thousands of employers for SEO talent. Companies in smaller markets or industries with low tech appeal struggle to attract experienced SEO professionals.

If hiring SEO talent is difficult, lean toward the agency or hybrid model. A mediocre in-house hire produces worse outcomes than a competent agency.

## Transition Planning

### Moving From Agency-Only to Hybrid

The most common transition. Your SEO program has matured to the point where strategic oversight needs to sit closer to the business.

**Step 1:** Hire the in-house SEO lead 60 days before changing the agency relationship. The new hire needs time to absorb the existing program, audit agency performance, and build internal relationships.

**Step 2:** Redefine the agency scope. Move strategy and stakeholder management to the in-house lead. Keep the agency for execution — content production, link building, technical implementation.

**Step 3:** Reduce the agency retainer proportionally. The in-house lead should negotiate scope reduction that reflects the shifted responsibilities.

**Step 4:** Establish a 90-day evaluation period. If the hybrid model produces better cross-functional integration and maintained execution quality, formalize it. If not, adjust the role split.

### Moving From Agency to Full In-House

This transition typically takes 12-18 months. Abrupt agency termination creates a capability gap that damages organic performance.

**Months 1-3:** Hire the SEO director or manager. Begin building institutional knowledge.

**Months 4-6:** Hire the first specialist (content or technical, depending on your primary need). Begin transitioning knowledge from the agency. The agency remains engaged for execution.

**Months 7-12:** Hire remaining team members. Agency scope narrows to specific functions the in-house team has not yet absorbed.

**Months 12-18:** Complete transition. Agency engagement ends or converts to a limited advisory retainer for periodic audits and external perspective.

Document everything the agency does during the transition. Process documentation, vendor relationships, tool access, editorial calendars, link building contacts — all of this needs to transfer to in-house ownership.

### When to Reverse the Decision

Sometimes an in-house team underperforms and an agency would serve better. Signs this is happening:

- In-house team is too small to cover all necessary functions and critical work gets neglected
- In-house team has developed strategic blind spots and resists external perspective
- Key team members leave and replacement hiring takes months
- The SEO program has plateaued despite stable investment

Reversing does not mean the original decision was wrong. It means circumstances changed. Treat it as a portfolio rebalancing, not a failure.

Consult the [agency audit framework](/articles/how-to-audit-seo-agency.html) and [vendor red flags guide](/articles/seo-vendor-red-flags-executives.html) before selecting a new agency partner.

## The Hidden Factor: Knowledge Continuity

The most underweighted consideration in this decision is knowledge continuity. When an agency churns your account manager — and they will, because agency turnover averages 30% annually — institutional knowledge resets. When an in-house hire leaves, the same reset occurs.

The model that best preserves knowledge continuity is the hybrid. The in-house lead accumulates and retains institutional knowledge. Agency execution personnel can turn over without losing strategic context because that context lives in-house.

Companies that change agencies every 18-24 months and have no in-house SEO knowledge holder effectively restart their SEO program each time. The compounding effect that makes organic search valuable never has time to develop.

Prioritize knowledge retention in whatever model you choose. Document strategies, not just tactics. Record why decisions were made, not just what was done. This documentation becomes the institutional memory that survives personnel changes.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### At what point does an in-house hire become cheaper than an agency?

When you need more than 40-50 hours per month of dedicated SEO work. An agency billing $8,000/month for 30-40 hours of mixed-seniority work reaches cost parity with an in-house hire at approximately $100,000 annually (fully loaded) who delivers 160+ focused hours per month. The in-house hire also provides institutional knowledge, cross-team integration, and full-time availability that the agency cannot match at the same cost.

### Can a marketing generalist handle SEO instead of hiring a specialist?

For basic SEO maintenance — publishing content, monitoring rankings, conducting quarterly audits — a capable marketing generalist can manage agency oversight or simple execution. For competitive organic markets, technical SEO challenges, or programs expected to be primary growth drivers, a specialist is necessary. The generalist approach works at low competition levels and breaks down as complexity increases.

### How do I evaluate whether my current agency should be replaced or supplemented?

Conduct a structured [agency audit](/articles/how-to-audit-seo-agency.html). Evaluate: are they meeting the KPIs agreed upon at engagement start? Is communication proactive or reactive? Do they present strategic recommendations or only execute what you request? Are they growing your organic metrics relative to competitors? If the agency performs well tactically but lacks strategic depth, supplement with an in-house lead. If performance is below expectations, replace.

### Should I hire an SEO manager or an SEO director as my first in-house hire?

Hire at the level that matches your expected scope of authority. If the hire will manage an agency and coordinate cross-functionally with VP-level stakeholders, hire at director level. If the hire will primarily execute SEO work and report to a marketing director, hire at manager level. Under-leveling the role creates organizational friction — a manager-level hire cannot effectively direct VP-level conversations or agency strategy.

### How do I prevent my agency from holding my SEO program hostage?

Ensure your company owns all assets: domain, **Google Search Console** access, **Google Analytics** property, content files, backlink relationship data, and strategy documentation. Include an IP and knowledge transfer clause in your agency contract. Conduct annual knowledge documentation reviews. If switching agencies requires rebuilding from scratch because the current agency owns the strategy documentation, you are in a vulnerable position that should be corrected immediately.
