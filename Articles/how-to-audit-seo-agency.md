# How to Audit an SEO Agency When You're Not an SEO Expert

Your agency sends a 47-page monthly report. It contains domain authority scores, keyword ranking tables, backlink acquisition numbers, and charts showing lines going up. You approve the invoice. You have no idea if the work was good.

This happens constantly. Marketing leaders pay $8,000 to $25,000 monthly for SEO services they can't evaluate.

## Red Flags in Agency Reporting

### Vanity Metrics That Hide Poor Performance

Watch for keyword counts without context, domain authority obsession, backlink acquisition volume without quality assessment, and impression growth without corresponding click growth.

### "Rankings Improved" Without Traffic or Revenue Increase

Rankings can improve while business results stay flat. Keyword cannibalization, SERP feature displacement, and irrelevant keyword targeting all explain this pattern.

### Reports That Explain What Was Done But Not Why It Matters

Activity reporting tells you what happened. Strategic reporting explains why it matters and connects to business outcomes.

## Questions to Ask in Monthly Calls

### "What Didn't Work This Month and What Are You Changing?"

This surfaces honesty, reveals strategic thinking, and builds trust.

### "How Does This Deliverable Connect to Our Revenue Goals?"

Force connection between activity and outcome for specific line items.

### "What Would You Do Differently If This Were Your Business?"

This question reveals constraint differences between agency recommendations and owner thinking.

## Spot-Checking Technical Work

### Using Free Tools to Verify Claimed Improvements

Page speed claims via PageSpeed Insights, indexation claims via Search Console, ranking claims via incognito searches, backlink claims via free tier tools.

### Asking for Before-and-After Screenshots With Timestamps

Crawl reports, speed test archives, Search Console screenshots, and backlink audit documentation should all be available on request.

## When to Fire Your Agency

### Knowing the Difference Between Slow Results and Bad Work

Slow results show forward progress with honest acknowledgment. Bad work shows circular motion with deflection.

### Extracting Deliverables and Documentation on Exit

Content, technical documentation, reporting history, tool access, and vendor contacts. Document everything before announcing termination.

### Avoiding Gaps When Switching

Hire replacement before terminating incumbent. Document current priorities. Maintain monitoring continuity.
