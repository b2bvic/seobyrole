# Fundamentals of Semantic SEO

Understanding and Grasping the Essence of the concepts below is a must for understanding all the lectures in the fundamentals section. Any concept below is not something that you have seen before, including Topical Authority, and Topical Maps.

When we use the concept of Topical Authority, or the Topical Maps, we do not mean "focus on topics, not keywords", or "topics in SEO", or "content planning", etc. The phrase and concept of Topical Map are directly used for the first time by me, even if I have seen cheap teachings around the concept, I couldn't see a proper topical map in over 2 years. If you watch the testimonial videos that we have published, and will be publishing, you will realize that most people who come to one-o-one training understand the essence of Topical Maps after spending 5–6 hours together. Thus, you will need to watch some of the recordings multiple times, and you will need to examine the free-training that I published over the past 2 years to get mindset support.

When it comes to the phrase topical authority, it is used by Google for the first time inside the Agent Rank Patent, but it is used for authors in an answer organization system, it is not used for websites. I didn't find or invent the "phrase," but I have given it a new definition. If you do not understand this definition, you will miss its essence.

"Topical Authority is ranking over an authoritative website for a certain amount of time with a lower cost-of-retrieval, higher accuracy, clarity, and information responsiveness by creating semantically organized content networks in the form of main and supplementary content by optimizing micro-macro semantics and contexts."

If you do not know what "main content", or "supplementary content", "content configuration", "micro-macro semantics", "macro-micro contexts", and contextual domains, knowledge domains, entity-attribute-value (EAV), knowledge-base, a semantic content network, and other related concepts mean, it means that when I say "topical authority", you think something else, and I say something else. If we can't communicate with the correct definitions that are bound by phrases that create the concepts, we can't progress.

Lastly, this course is not about using an SEO tool better, it is about using your brain better. Your brain is already semantically perfected by God/Gods, or/and History of Evolution, thus, trust reason, and logic while learning lectures, you will be learning your own brain reflexes. You will discipline your mind, and you will have a structured thought-stream to define, associate, and communicate.

- **Topical Authority** is a state as formulized in "Topical Coverage * Historical Data".
    - Most SEOs think that they understand this definition easily, but they do not.
    - For example, what is Historical Data?
    - Which website below has higher historical data.
        - A website with 2 years of ranking history, or a website with 10 years of ranking history?
        - What if the website with 10 years of ranking history has just 1 session, while a website with 2 years of ranking history has over 10,000,000 sessions.
        
    - **Historical Data** is not about "time", it is about "user engagement" and the quality of this "engagement".
        - A mouse-over, impression, and ranking in the 94th ranking is included in the historical data.
        - Non-quality user-engagement or query session logs can demote your website after a certain amount of time.
        - If you lose your rankings today, it is because of the historical data from 6 months ago.
        - It means that your current state comes from at least a half year ago.
        - Cleaning the bad historical data for a website, requires a good historical data with a stronger signal.
- What is **Topical Coverage**? Is it just opening a new web page for every topic, or asking a question for every entity
    - Learn this, Stuffing Entities are not providing higher rankings.
    - Stuffing attributes won't provide higher topical coverage either.
    - **Topical Coverage** is not measured by the number of web pages, or mentions of entities.
    - If you didn't define X, it means you didn't cover it.
    - If you didn't connect X to Y, it means you didn't cover it.
    - If you didn't match the Macro-context of the web document to the Query Context, it means you didn't cover the entity inside the query with the proper context.
    - If your definition misses certain types of aspects, it means you didn't cover it.
    - To be able to rank higher for the "Electric Scooters", defining the "range", or "charger" concepts are needed.
        - Telling "battery quality" or "battery charge duration" is not good enough.
        - Going for operating temperature, safety features, voltage, capacity, cycle life, discharge rate, size and shape, energy density, warranty, brand reputation, maintenance, durability are needed.
        - And, going for durability (of the battery) against vibration, wear and tear, exposure to water, shock, overcharging, charging frequency, age, bad storage conditions, humidity, and high or very low temperatures is needed.
        - And going for durability of the battery of an electric scooter based on its chemical composition requires going for lithium iron phospohate (LiFePO4), Nickel Cobalt Alumunium Oxide (NCA), Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide (NMC), Lithium Nickel Cobalt Aluminum Oxide (NCA), Lithium Titanate Oxide (LTO), Lithium Polymer (LiPo), Nickel Iron (NiFe), Zinc-air (Zn-Air), Sodium Nickel Chloride (NaNicI).
        - Going for battery voltage, operating voltage, voltage regulator, charging voltage, peak voltage, voltage display, voltage stability, voltage conversion (motor voltage), nominal voltage, and charging voltage is needed.
    - So, will you open new pages for all these? Or will you include all these on a single page?
    - If you include them on a single web page, how will they be ordered?
    - What questions should I ask, and what answers should I write?
    - Or what prompts to use, and how to train AGI to process these with the correct context.
    - If you process LifePO4 with Electric Scooter directly in your H₁, you will be diluting your context.
    - If you include it in a different macro-context, you will be expanding your topical map.
    - But where a topic starts and end? Or whether these borders change, or are they fixed?
    - If a competitor manages to change the contextual borders of a topic, does it mean that your topical coverage is decreased despite you cover the same amount of contexts?
    - Even if you process all these battery materials, if you do not connect them back to the battery related attributes, you will be diluting your context, and topical consolidation.
    - Even if you process all these battery materials, if you connect them only to electric scooter batteries, still you will be diluting the context, even if you increase topical consolidation.
- **Topical Coverage** is determined based on the complete-comprehensive and structured process of information on web documents that are designed based on possible and related search activities.
    - If I talk about possible and related search activities, it will be a little black-hat.
    - But if we continue from the "complete-comprehensive and structured process of information", it means that an entity is processed with every attribute, for any possible connection, by completing every possible factual relevance, and processed in a web document for higher Relevance and Responsiveness.
    - **Relevance and Responsiveness** are not the same.
        - Relevance is for improving Information Retrieval Score which comes from Term-weight Calculation, and Reading the Retriever's mind with math algorithms.
        - **Responsiveness** is a direct Information Extraction Process, and it requires a direct answer that satisfies the possible or related search activities.
        - For the query "Cancer", the possible and related search activities might be "learn cancer", "go cancer treatment", "compare cancer treatment methods", or "cancer treatment center comparison", or millions of different combinations can be created.
        - The **Represented and Representative Queries** are concepts from **Query Processing**.
        - For a single-word query such as "cancer", the distribution of probabilities comes from query variations, search behaviors, and query search demand, which creates Query Semantics.
        - To understand the Relevance, the web document has to be relevant to all the possible interpretations of the single-word query.
        - To provide the Responsiveness, the web document has to satisfy all the possible needs behind the query.
        - But, search engines interpret queries not just based on query semantics, sometimes they assume the highest PageRank, or most authoritative source interpreted the query correctly, and they bring SERP the most similar other web documents.
        - The **Semantic Distance** between the queries change continuously, thus during and after the Broad Core Algorithm Updates (BCAUs), the SERP characteristics (SERP Features), and ranking web source and document types change tremendously.
    - To increase the Topical Coverage, a web source shouldn't go for irrelevant topics without completing the previous one.
    - The quality of a topical map, and a semantic content network (collection of connected web documents that are semantically optimized for a topic) can affect the rankings of the web source for another topic.
    - The non-quality pages will cause other quality pages rank lowered.
    - Topical coverage is the collection of related topics with a specific contextual connection, and a knowledge domain that involves all the related entities, and attributes with accurate verbalization in a web source's content network.
        - To consolidate the topics under a context, and increase the contextual relevance of the web source, the topical coverage should be increased with the documents that are optimized with macro and micro semantics with macro and micro contexts.
        - For example, a document with "20 Facts about Lithium Iron Phosphate" can't be connected to the Electric Scooter directly, the association here is weak because search engine doesn't have query sequences, paths, or documents that mention these two together, thus it can't trigger a new inverted index, or bring other inverted indexes together.
        - Thus, it requires processing, batteries, battery types, batteries for electric scooters, and battery production, battery materials separately from each other. To consolidate the context further, comparing batteries of electric scooters to the electric bikes, and calculating the distance difference between electric scooters to the electric cars, and electric scooters to the electric bikes is needed.
        - Mentioning the word "battery" in a simple way, and stuffing 99+ sponsored links to the web documents means that this is a sponsored web source, and every mention of every concept, whether a brand, product, or product dimension, is paid.
        - Using a properly constructed knowledge base in the form of a semantically optimized content network is needed to increase topical coverage properly.
- The **Macro Semantics** involve the overall characteristics of a content network from the point of view of semantics.
    - For example, what are the site-wide N-grams that can appear on a website?
    - What are the most used nouns, adjectives, or predicates site-wide?
    - What are the most commonly used question formats site-wide?
    - What types of queries are targeted overall? Do they start with what, or a superlative word?
    - How are the heading vectors are constructed?
    - What are the first words of the paragraphs? Do they answer the question, or do they use rhetoric without information?
    - Do they link to other pages without giving a single answer?
    - What are the heaviest context terms in the web documents?
    - Do context terms match the query context?
        - For example if a search engine interprets a query like "movie 20", as the "best 20 movies", or "movies for 20 years old", or "The Movie called 20", or "Movies from 20s", or "Movies for 20s", the web document will need to distribute the probabilities, and arrange the contextual flow from macro context to the micro contexts.
            - Imitating the SERP always won't solve the problem, but Understanding the Reason behind the SERP will.
- **Micro Semantics** involve the sequence modeling, word-by-word optimization of the documents for a higher relevance and responsiveness.
    - It involves the optimization of the visuals with subject and object entities.
        - The subject entity is the most concrete and tangible object in the visuals.
        - Object entities are interpreting the context of the image by changing certain interpreations. Like, "a fish and a bear", or "a lake and a bear".
    - **Sequence modeling** is a term from Natural Language Processing, that involves changing the word sequences for higher responsiveness and contextualization.
    - For example the "Teacher yelled students", and "Students are yelled by Teacher" word sequences do not distribute the relevance in the same way. In the first one, "teacher" is heavier, and in the second one "students" are heavier for the contextualization.
    - The predicates are important to signal the overall context, the predicate "yell" annotate a different context from the "shout", and all the probabilities of word sequences change.
    - **Micro-semantics** are heavily important, because right now, we are already creating websites by downloading the knowledge bases and verbalizing them with LLMs, and optimizing an LLM with micro-touches creates huge relevance and responsiveness differences.
- Main Content is the main part of a web document.
    - It involves all the context-terms, topical entries, and main entities inside the web document.
    - It gives the main context-flow, and coverage while also including a summary of the entire article.
    - It doesn't touch sub-contexts, or minor topics.
    - It processes the macro-context of the document and provides a proper connection to query contexts and semantics.
    - It doesn't involve too many internal links, unless it is inside the macro-context.

- **Supplementary Content** touches the micro-contexts, sub-topics, and it provides internal links to the side-topics.

    - Supplementary content is used to provide a better association, and "Neighborhood Content" between different segments of the topical map.
    - The supplementary content is always connected to macro-context of the web page, but it processes it with a connection to another macro-context.

- **Topical Map** is a concept and phrase that I found, used for the first time during the interview with Matt Diggity. The main problem with the concept is that it was a simplification, thus it is even more simplified. I have seen people use the concept of topical maps as connections between entities via attributes, or blog post names to process without any understanding of context, or semantics. To create a proper topical map, you have to understand the concepts below.

    - **Source Context** is the purpose of the source (website, and web entity (CEO, Social Media Platforms, and collections of other web aspects of brand)), how the brand monetizes its content, and how it turns search engine users into customers and clients.

        - Source Context has to be connected to the Central Entity with a proper attribute.

            - For example, if the source context is "Visa Consultuncy", certain types of web components such as "input elements" signal conversion points during the HTML Normalization.
            - And, concept of "Visa Consultuncy" has to be united to any other aspects of a "country", whether it is about country's culture, religion, geography, climate.
            - If the source context is "Real Estate Consultuncy", the "country" attributes will be connected to the "Real Estate Investment". The climate of the country will be processed for types of properties to invest in, or the climate's effect on real estate investment, not for the best time to visit a country.
            - The macro-context of the "climate" node has to be on "climate", but the micro-context and supplementary content connections will change according to the Source-context.
            - The Source Context is connected to the site-wide N-grams, the source's context has to be reflected on the website on every web page, in boilerplate, and in the main content as well.

    - **Core Section** of the topical map is the unification of the source context with the central search intent. Central search intent is the intent that will be reflected site-wide, and all the sections of the topical map and the semantic content briefs whether in the macro-context, or in the micro-context areas.

        - Core Section of the Topical Map focuses on a specific main attribute of the central entity.
        - The specific attribute of the central entity comes from the source context.

            - For example, if you are an affiliate for electric car chargers, the "quality" is the main attribute, and "durability, charge time, or maintenance" are the "derived attributes" from the main attribute.
            - For example, if you are an engineering company for electric car chargers, the "production" is the main attribute, and "materials, designs, types" are the derived attributes.
- According to the Source Context, the Core Section of the Topical map has to be densified further.

    - **Outer Section** of the topical map is to improve the overall historical data (explained at the top). It is to increase overall topical relevance, and contextual consolidation of the web source for the specific entity.

        - The outer section of the topical map focuses on the minor attributes of the entity, not the main attributes.
        - Outer section of the topical map propogate the trust, and quality signals to the core section of the topical map with links or linkless connections.
        - For example, if it is for "Visa Consultuncy", the core section of the topical map will focus on the "Visa" attribute, while the outer section focuses on all other attributes for a country, whether "religion", or "language schools".
        - For example, if it is for "Pension and Retirement Planning (401k plan, ROTH IRA, Required Minimum Distribution, Catch-up Conditions, Long-term Care Insurance, Reverse Mortgage, Individual Mortgage, Other sub-types, or alternatives to it)", the core section of the topical map will be about "Retirement" under the context of "Financial Independence", and the outer section will be focusing on all Financial Aspects and Elderly Life (Elder Law Attorney, Power of Attorney, Estate Planning, Gifting, Annuity, Medicaid, Retirement Community).
        - For example, if it is for the "Divorce Lawyer", anything related to the predicate "divorce (mediation, trial, property division, separation agreement, alimony, petition, child custody, support)", and "legal (grounds, prenuptial agreement, default judgement, emancipation, temporary orders, annulment, discovery, marital property)" context will be in the main part of topical map, and anything related to marriage (statistics, relationship mistakes, types, dynamics), and roles (any adjective that can be used for husband, or wife, or any other term like child), or marriage functions (financial partnership, companionship, communication, household responsibilities, physical intimacy, emotional support) in marriage will be in the outer context.

    - **Central Entity** is the entity that appears in every subsection of the semantic content network whether in main content and macro context, or supplementary content and micro context.

        - **Central Entity** is the entity that gives its main and minor attributes to the core and outer sections of the topical map.
        - **Central Entity** always appears inside the anchor texts with a synonym value.
        - Central Entity and **Source Context** are united together to create a connection and major focus on the website content for creating a connection to the users' possible and related search activities.

            - You can have the best web page, and best possible content for "cancer treatment", but if you are not a doctor, search engine won't rank you, because users won't be able to perform its end-goal.
            - Thus, reflecting possible and related search activities with proper web page layout and web components is needed.
            - You can have the most relevant and highly responsive content, and all the PageRank for the query of "credit calculation," but if there is no calculator on the page, you can rank for "credit calculation formula", but not for the "cheapest loans" or "lowest interest rate loans".

                - If there is no application form or possibility, you can't rank for highly commercial queries.
                - Sometime search engines replace aggregators with direct instutions that users can apply, because it decreases the counts of clicks, and web page count for the final "search behavior" which is connected to "real world behavior" (another time we can explain this further.).

        - Central Entity determines the direction of the topical map for being classified properly with the authoritative sources to outrank these sources in the future BCAUs.

    - **Central Search Intent** is the intent that will appear in all the topical map, and semantic content networks whether it is in boilerplate, or main content.

        - The central search intent is the unification of the source context with central entity.
        - The central search intent is heavily processed in the core section of topical map.
        - The central search intent is reflected on the outer section of the topical map.

- **Content Configuration** is the process of changing, and updating the existing content according to the changed semantic distances, or similarities, and increasing the relevance and responsiveness continuously.
- **Publication Frequency (Momentum)** is the frequency of major content updates, or new content publications to take the attention of the search engine to be prioritized for being crawled, indexed, and ranked earlier and higher.
- Contextual Coverage is the context that covers a certain portion of the web page.

    - If a context is heavily and vastly processed, it will dilute the prominence of other sections.
    - If a context is processed lightly, but connected to the certain interpreations of the query, it will decrease the relevance.

- **Contextual Flow is the order in which contexts are processed.**

    - Processing the same things with different order will create different possible click satisfaction scores.
    - Heading formats, heading words, or heading hierarchies change the context's priority.

- **Contextual Hierarchy** is to adjust the weight of a context's coverage.

    - Contextual Hierarchy is represented with the typography, visuals, coverage of the specific sub-section of the web page.
    - Contextual Hierarchy changes the weight of an internal link for relevance and PageRank pass.
    - Contextual Hierarchy changes the macro-context of the web page.

- **Contextual Border** is the border between macro-micro context section of the web page.

    - It provides a slow transition from main content to supplementary content.
    - It provides a grouper question to deepen the main context while connecting it to other side-topics.
- **Contextual Bridge** is the connection between two different topical map node.
    - It is provided by aligning and consistent information without a link.
    - It is provided with a hypertext for providing contextual connection between two different topical map nodes.
- **Vastness-Depth-Momentum** is a simplification that I do for all these things. Basically it means, go wider, go deeper, go faster.
    - If you can't create a "wide source", go even deeper and faster. If you can't go faster, create way much more wider and deeper.
    - It means that whichever is missing from out of these three, you have to complete its missing effect by improving another.
    - You can create a bigger topical map, or really deep content briefs for a small topical map.
    - You can publish lots of things quickly, or you can publish deep, comprehensive and complete web documents for a topic slowly.

There are many other concepts to process under the context of Topical Authority. Thus, when I say Topical Authority, and Topical Maps, the thing that I invented and coined is too different from what you thought before. And, unfortunately until this very moment, it wasn't possible to explain these publicly. Most of these concepts will fit into your mindset when you watch the lectures multiple times. Whenever you watch these lectures, you will learn something new, and realize something that you didn't realize before.

This course was not created for quick hacks, shiny things, and I never offered easy things. SEO is a highly complex discipline, and thanks to Artificial General Intelligence, it will be way more complicated with the rise of new search engines.

"This is not an upgrade for your SEO Toolset, but it is an upgrade for your Mindset.  
The course is for leveling up your brain capacity, and teaching you new brain reflexes, and thought streams while improving your conceptualization skills, and awareness of the surrounding semantic world."

A quick conceptualization table for the concepts is below.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Concept|Explanation From Me|
|Micro Semantics|Process of optimizing sequences of words, phrase co-occurrences, and sentence structures for increasing relevance and responsiveness. Includes discourse integration optimization, and sequence-to-sequence connections for changing contextualization.|
|Main Content|The main part of the web document that processes the specific context-terms, and topical entries. It satisfies the major query needs, and touches on the minor query needs with the contextual border. This is where the macro-context is processed.|
|Supplementary Content|The supplementary part of the web document is where the micro-contexts, minor entities, and attributes are processed in a connected way to the macro-context and main content. It involves more internal links and contextual bridges with links or linkless connections.|
|Topical Map|The topical map has the core and outer sections to process the central entity with the main and minor attributes. A topical map is intended to provide a better topical coverage by focusing on all the query networks and query contexts in these search terms, increasing site-wide relevance and responsiveness with higher historical data and quality session logs.|
|Source Context|The purpose of the brand identity, and how the brand monetizes its content. It represents the main focus of the website, and its connection to the central entity.|
|Central Entity|The entity that appears in the core and outer sections of the topical map, and all the site-wide n-grams, and context-terms are related to the central entity. It is covered site-wide, and every topical map node, from main or supplementary content, has to touch it.|
|Central Search Intent|The central search intent is the unification of the central entity and the source context. It is processed in both of the outer and core sections of the topical map. It is connected to the macro-context, and micro-context of every content brief, and every part of the semantic content network.|
|Content Configuration|Process of optimizing relevance and responsiveness continuously according to the changed semantic distances and similarities of the query terms. It comes from changed query semantics, and it requires refreshing and re-configuring the topical maps. Most of the time, if the web source is already topical authority, it means that configuration will be needed from the competitor side, mostly.|
|Publication Frequency|The momentum. The purpose of publication frequency is to be prioritized for crawling rate, and indexation, it is prioritized for higher rankings, and taking the attenion of the search engine content exploration systems.|
|Contextual Coverage|The number of web page document section for a specific context compared to the other sections. It can dilute the relevance or increase the relevance. It is connected to the Passage Indexing (Ranking), and it is needed to not break the Contextual Vector.|
|Contextual Flow|The order of the processed contextual vectors that represents contextual domains and knowledge domains in the web document. Order of headings, questions, or paragraphs change the relevance of a document. It determines what is processed under what circumstances. It changes the weight of the sections, and the contextual connections.|
|Contextual Hierarchy|Connected to the Contextual Flow. It determines which contextual vector comes before which one. The order of the contextual segments on a web document changes the overall connection to the search terms.|
|Contextual Border|The border between the macro-micro contexts, and main and supplementary content sections on a web document. It provides a transition from major query needs to the minor query needs with further associations.|
|Contextual Bridge|Hypertext, or linkless connections in a semantic content network. It helps semantic content network to complete itself with different part. It focuses on query paths, sequences, and correlative queries.|
|Vastness-Depth-Momentum|A simplification to explain everything in a semantic content network, and a topical map for gaining topical authority.  Go faster, go deeper, go wider. If one of these is missing, complete its missing effect by increasing another.|
|Topical Authority|Ranking higher for a certain amount of time compared to other web sources with higher clarity, accuracy, information quality, and responsiveness for a cheaper search engine evaluation and retrieval process so that the web source is preferred by the search engine for certain topics for prioritized rankings. Basically, it is not "focus topics, instead of keywords, or SEO in topics". Learn concepts properly, and credit the original source.|
|Historical Data|Not time.<br><br>Amount of user engagement for a certain amount of time.<br><br>Fresh historical data is more important than older historical data.<br><br>There are negative, neutral and positive historical data types according to the behaviors of the users, whether it is a hover-over, click, touch, text-select, clickless search, etc.|
|Topical Coverage|Requires creating a topical border to calculate the topical coverage.<br><br>It involves the connected attributes, knowledge domains and contextual domains for a specific query network.<br><br>It can't be increased by stuffing entities, attributes, or opening a new page for everything.<br><br>Processing every macro and micro context for a knowledge domain by connecting and associating every entity via their attributes, including all the content-formats, with proper web page layout and components for signaling the related and possible search activities that come from the query context, aspect, and definition based on query semantics.|
|Relevance|The Information Retrieval Score that comes from certain text processing methodologies such as term saturation, length normalization, co-occurrence matrix construction, BM25, TF-IDF, GlovE, Word2Vec and more. It shows overall connection, but it is still the Blind Librarian state of the search engine.|
|Responsiveness|The Information Extraction Process of the Search Engines for giving the direct answer, even if there is no relevance, there might be a quality answer. Thus, it requires query-question-answer pairing, and indexing. Thus, it is connected to Passage Indexing (Ranking).|
|Represented and Representative Queries|A search term has representative and represented query versions for expressing itself.<br><br>This is not what you would call "seed query", or "tail queries".<br><br>Search engines do not give the full weight of relevance to the terms that are put into the search bar. The relevance of the terms in the search bar is distributed based mainly on the representative queries. For example, the queries "board vision", and "vision board" can give different results, even if they mostly mean the same thing, because there will be different contextual connections, and query interpretations for both of them.<br><br>This indicates that the representative query has access to the represented query's relevance.|
|Topical Map|A content network design based on semantics for achieving the topical authority state by including overall macro contexts and semantics with publication frequency.|
|Contextual Relevance|Contextual appropriateness and significance of terms for the given context to reflect the meaning of the term in that context.<br><br>The noun love might have a "sexual, or religious" context.|
|Macro Semantics|Macro Semantics is the semantics for the main and prominent parts of the web documents' relevance and context whether it comes from headings, anchor texts, site-wide n-grams.|
|Micro Semantics|Micro Semantics is the semantics for the micro-adjustments for context and relevance, whether it comes from a single word change, punctuation, or word-order.|
|Understanding SERP|A quick phrase to annotate the process of understanding the search engine reasoning behind the results for query search terms.|

# Topical Authority Formula
*'X website outranks Y website for Z topic for P months'*
Creates a Re-ranking Trigger for related topics.

But when?
After a BCAU (Broad Core Algorithm Update) are assumed to be the times that Google updates their databases

# Reflect Main Topic of Website
- Has to be connects to a website's source context
- Where you get traffic determines main topic of website.

Website A:
- Has 999 pages of Porn
- Has 1 sessions for these 000 pages
vs.
- has 1 page about Bible
- Has 1 million organic sessions for this 

Is this a porn or bible website?

Link most Quality Web pages from Homepage for Targeted Topics.

- Understand Quality Nodes

"To change the main topic of the website, i create a semantic content network, then pout everything to the homepage, then google does the rest"

# Macro and Micro Semantics
- Semantics are language-agnostic
- If they work in one language, they will work in others


# Algorithmic Authorship and Cotnent Engineering
- Art of organizing humans with algorithmic rules of writing and content structuring according to LLMs

Which sentence is more relevant? (Relevance Configuration)

Query: "what is a penguin"

1. Penguin is a flighless seabirds with flippers instead of winds that live almost exclusively below the equator (first query)
3. Penguin is a flighless seabirds that live almost exclusively below the equator
4.  Penguin is a flighless seabirds that live almost exclusively below the equator and they have flippers instead of wings (last query)
  
Query: "where does a penguin live"

- a 0.1% relevance increase applied across each sentence in the content network = higher relevance

## Prioritze Attributes and Contexts
Interrogative Term: Where is signal for place

- Need to understand how to process the queries like a search engine does
- Need to understand all possible contexts
- There are over 200 rules of Algorithmic Authorship
- Creating a Large Language Models with Human Authors
- "wwat kind of sentence before lists, after lists, before headings, after headings, etc."


# Rule #1: Be Certain.
- Learn the difference between stated fact and opinion.
- Use the correct modality
- These are subsects of Neural Linguistic Programming
    - "Sun will rise tomorrow" is opinion
    - "Sun rises everyday" is fact

# Rule #2: Cut the fluff out.

Bad example:
"**There is one more fact about** electric cars that **every** driver **should know,** **and it is the** electric charger capacity. **Also,** **according to the electric** charger type, **the** electric battery charging time **might** vary."

Good example:
"**Electric car charging** time change s based on **electric car charger type**. For example, **X type car charger** is observed to be 5% **faster** compared to **Y type of electric car charger.**"

***Delete all contextless words.***

Experts are specific.

## Example 3
Use Numeric Values.
- Do not tell "There are many reasons..."
- Tell, "There are 5 main reasons..."

## Example 4
Qualify the instances.
- Do not tell, "The symptoms of X disease"
- Tell, "There are 6 **severe symptoms** of X disease, there are.... There are 9 **rare symptoms of X**"


## Example 5
Understand Context of Verbs
- 'Increase' signals 'Health'
- 'Improve' signals 'Skill' + 'Health'
- 'Develop' signals 'Skill'

*If you check the verbs, each one has a different type of 'contextual zone'*

## Example 6
Give examples after a plural noun
- "There are 40 different cryptocurrencies to trade in Coinbase including Bitcoin, et al."

Determine predicates wisely.

## Example 7
Use the same Part of Speech Tag (Word Role) in the first word of sentence for a listing
- Ensure (Verb) + Noun
- Clear (verb) + Noun
- Spend (verb) + Noun
- Absorb (verb) + Noun

*Follow the same PoST for all sentences.*

## Example 8
Optimize Subordinate Text first Sentence

**Heading:** *How to do X...*
**Wrong Subordinate Text:** *X is...*
**Correct Subordinate Text:** *To do X...*

*Match the Adjectives, Predicates, Nouns order between Questions and Answers.*

- This means that search engines are not checking the entire text. The sentence after headings (subordinate) need to follow the correct structure.

## Example 9
Put the 'if' statements in the second part of the sentence
- "If A becomes B, do X"
- "Do X, if A becomes"
*First declaration, then the constraints*

## Example 10
Match Anchor Text with the Targeted Web Page's Title

- **Targeted Web Page Title**: 10 Ways to Improve Sleep Efficiency
- **Source Web Page Title**: Sleep Quality Test
- **Heading**: What is Sleep Efficiency?
- **Possible Anchor Text**: Sleep Effiency

*Match Anchor Text and its context between Source and Target*

## Example 11
Do not delay the answer.

- **Question**: What are the benefits of Vision Boards for entreprenuers?
- **Wrong Structure**: Vision boards are the boards for... To prepare a Vision Board... Benifits of Vision Boards...
- **Correct Structure**: There are X main benefits of a Vision Board for na entrepreneur...

*Singulartiy and Plurality matter for microsemantics*


## Example 12
Bold the answer, not the search term.
- Query: What is a Penguin?
- Incorrect Answer: **A penguin** is a flightless seabird.
- Correct Answer: A penguin is a **flightless searbird**.

*Signal the answer part, not the relevance.*

 
# Instructions
- Be cheaper.
    - Cost of Retrieval - Cost of ranking a website can't be higher than cost of 'not' ranking the website.

## Which one is cheaper?
**Website A**
- 600 Content Items (Web Pages)
- 900 Triples
- 59% Accuracy
- 3 Connected Topics
- Clarity 78%

**Website B**
- 1400 Content Items (Web Pages)
- 1200 Triples
- 94% Accuracy
- 7 Connected Topics
- Clarity 96%

Takeaways:
- "To satisfy 9 million search queries, I won't rank 9 million different websites."
- If I am able to provide better information, in a semantically-organized way, it will have lower cost of retrieval.
- Topical Autority is born from the idea of Decreasing the Cost of Retrieval

## Have Query Responsiveness
- It's about giving the correct informaiton to the search engines as much as possible.

**Information Retrieval**
- Query to Document Relevance
- Document to Query Relevance
- Document to Document Similarity
- Query to Query Similarity

**Information Extraction**
- Trying to understand the sentence structure for highest-responsive answer at the earliest point
- Query to Questions, and Question to Answer
- Focus on Question and Answer Generation for Information Retreival

## Generate Unique Questions
### Information Responsiveness
Information Responsiveness is involving the respective entity, attribute, value combinations with a macros and micro context distribution, across multiple semantically-organized content network to prove overall quality and relevance of informaiton.

## Entity Identity Creation
Use Informaiton Responsiveness, Quality and Accuracy to Change Google's perception against Popular and High-level PageRank sources

If you can convince Google that "X is Y, but not Z" with semantics, it means that your topical map will be the knowledge base.

A website will rank only if they are similar to you

***Make your competitors imitate you.***

## Understand Comparative Ranking & Leverage LLMs
- Do not publish hundreds of articles all at once
- Build the momentum and batch release


# LLMo Optimization for SEO
1. Fine-tune an LLM
2. Create a Topical Map
3. Create a Semantic Content Network
4. Generate Content
5. Include Human Effort (this is part of the quality)
6. **Improve your Knowledge Base**
7. **Make your website a Speaking AI**

Best possible expert client, starts talking to clients based on the information (AKA User-Generated Prompts)

- Find a Knowledge Base
- Verbalize the Knowledge Base
- Use Natural Language Inference with Chain of Reasoning
    - This sorts of inference technologies are 'expensive' to retreive with algorithms
- LLMs use black-listed and white-listed words
    - LLMs leave signatures of their use in the output language themselves
- "Author Authority Vectors"

# Who is going to win?
**The SEO who understands, not the SEO who imitates.**

## How a search engine processes text
- Google Patent: [Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval](https:medium.com/lily-lab/a-brief-introduction-to-cross-lingual-information-retrieval-eba767fa9af6)
- 40 different sentences, 40 different languages
- Geography proximity of languages create closer contextual embedding
- 'Zoom in' to specific word vectors
- Semantic distance between queries

## Some Research Papers andc Patents from Google
- David C. Taylor - Context and Knowledge Domains with Embeddings
    - SEO by the Sea - [Google Patents Context Vectors to Improve Search](https:www.seobythesea.com/2016/10/google-patents-context-vectors-improve-search/)
- Finding the 'Source Context' and where the 'borders' of other subjects exist

## How to Understand Language Models and Semnatic Connections within them
- 'Quartz' and 'Cleaner'
- Create the logical connection between your website and the context vector
- Headings and Body text are dependent upon the contextual understanding of the query, and related queries that border that topic
---
- 'Quartz' and 'Ultrasonic'
- Macro Context: 'Quartz Ultrasonic Absorption and Measurement'.
- Micro Contenxt: 'Ultrasonic Cleaning for Quartz Surfaces'
- **Zertec and its products is signifier**.

## What is Large Language Model Optimization?
A Language interpretiy Tool by Google is published. You can check 'Word Compositions' and 'Embeddings' for certain contexts.

- Sequence Modeling (Word Compositionality Modeling) is backbone of Semantic SEO
- What is the possibility of 'Cat' appears with predicates of 'chase', 'eat', or 'fly'?
- Large Language Model Iptimization and Answer Engine Optimization are different technical expressions for Semantic Search Engine Optimization


## A manual exercise for 'sensing search timeline'
**Query**: Best Wineries in Croatia
**Question**: What are the best wineries in Croatia?
**Question Interoperations**: How do compare wineries to each other / Croatia?
**Context**: Definition of Winery Definition
**Phrase**: Small/Big Wineries White, Red

**Possible Document Design**
*Best Wineries in Croatia*
**Document Title**: X Best Wineries in Croatia to Visit
**Source Context**: Travel Guide - Tourist Tips for Croatia
**Document Context**: Visiting a Winery Comparing Wineries Learning New
**Information Tree**: Croatia > Culture > Drink > Wine > Winery 
**Answer Terms**: Specific Named Entities within Winery type in Croatia

The source context and document context need to be connected back to the query context. Otherwise there will be semantic distance.

## An Example of Relevance Configuration
'*Financial Advisor helps families to acheive financial independence.*'
**Possible Search Queries**: 'Financial Advisor + Fmaily'

- **Macro Context**: 'Financial Advisor'
- **Possible Representative Question**: 'What does Financial Advisory help families for?'

---

'*Families achieve financial Independence with the help of the financial advisor.*'
**Possible Search Queries**: 'Family + Financial Independence'

- **Macro Context**: 'Family Economics'
- **Possible Representative Question**: 'How does a family achieve financial independence?'

"Helpful" content isn't the point, it's about higher relevance and responsiveness to the query. Both sentences are helpful. One of them has higher relevance.


'Purple Yam' -> 'Sweet Potatoes'

## What's the game of Google?
- How does Google prepare itself?
    - Response generation
    - Hard part is not generating responses, but generating diveerse perspectives, making answers accessible, and increasing accuracy

## From Document Ranking to Contextual Answer Ranking
- Quality
- Sensibleness
- Specificity
- Interestingness
- Safety
- Groundedness (most important)

Topical Authority goal is to the be the consensus source.
- If your competition has to copy you, you 'set the bar' on how far you 'can go' with the content.
- Be reasonable with your content





## 0 The Course - Topical Authority Course - The Beginning


**

# The Course - Topical Authority Course - The Beginning 

# Intro (Prior To Lecture 1) 

## Principles 

- Personal - Learn, Earn, Rank 
    
- Community - Share, Help, Grow
    

## Brief General Statements - Topical Authority (TA) 

- Black hat method - Koray sent a DDOS attack to his competitors, this only increased their rankings as google viewed this direct traffic, as them having a brand and being highly authoritative, considering they are getting direct traffic, in conjunction with them having a high page rank. Rankmerge = Direct Traffic + Pagerank 
    

  

## Underlying Principles Of TA 

Topical Authority = Historical Data x Topical Coverage 

- Publishing frequency is one, if not the most important element/aspect of TA, as without some level of consistency that increases in frequency, if there is no frequency and subsequent increase you won’t be able to get the search engine, to look at your source, and rerank it, or properly crawl and index your whole website and the topics within it (that you’re hoping to achieve TA for). 
    
- Topical Map + Semantically Organised Content Network With A Knowledge Base = Semantic Content Network (SCN)
    
- Context And Koray’s Framework (Koraynese) 
    
- Everything Is About Context In Semantics 
    
- Koray’s Framework = Contextual Vector + Contextual Hierarchy + Contextual Structure + Contextual Connection + Contextual Coverage and flow
    
- When it comes to an SCN, every heading, first sentence after heading, paragraph, anchor text, anchor text positions, table, table column, list item, sentence before and after list and question and answer format 
    
- Not every article in a semantic content network needs to be good, but there need to be quality nodes (most important articles, keep them linked on your homepage and therefore closer to the crawlers)
    

  

Understand Macro Semantics = Topical Map + Context Distribution 

Understand Macro Semantics = SMC + Context Construction 

  

Basic Formula For TA = X website outranks Y website for z topic for p months - creates a re-ranking for related topics on X website - When is the real question? - Core algorithm updates are the most important times for re-ranking to occur. Even if the website is optimised you can still lose traffic until the Core Algorithm Update. You must wait for a core algorithm update (where you get feedback from the algorithm and can make adjustments).

  

In order to be able to use TA, you always must use the main topic that is connected to the website’s source context. Your main topic is typically explained by where/what webpages you are getting your traffic to. Not all articles/nodes within a topical map will be of the absolute highest quality, some are just there for topical coverage (to have a topic covered). High page rank with no traffic will not allow you to prove your authority over a particular knowledge domain or topic. Quality nodes are the most important articles that should be placed on the homepage, and should be placed closer for the crawlers (requiring the crawlers to crawl less to find these pages/articles/quality nodes as they are more important, and shouldn’t be as deep in your website). 

  

Semantics are language agnostic (the semantics, content brief and topical map are applicable to different languages even if they’re in english) 

  
  
  

Subordinate Text - Refers to the first sentence after the first heading 

Topical authority is based off of the idea of reducing the cost of retrieval for your website

  

## Algorithmic Authorship and Content Engineering 

In Micro Semantics, we are playing with sequences, orders and compositionality of words, in order to increase the relevance of a sentence to the talked about topic. In other words, we are making ‘micro’ adjustments to words in order for them to be easier for NLP/Google to understand  in relation to a topic we are writing about. 

  

Prioritising attributes and contexts is about finding / defining the signalling places for the relevant attributes in sentences.

Use interrogative terms for such signals

Examples of interrogative terms include "what," "who," "when," "where," "why," and "how." These words are used to form questions that require a specific answer or explanation. For example, "What is your name?" or "Where do you live?" - The interrogative term of where requires a destination, or place, that must be mentioned in relation to the entity mentioned in the query, which in this instance is you.

  

Single word queries, like “penguin”, will create a need to understand and satisfy all the possible contexts.

  

Koray’s Rules For Algorithmic Authorship (Total of 200, Typically authors follow 39, and he gives us 14) - I copied some of these of someone who shared their notes underneath the saigon lecture (I’m unable to find him to credit him - If this is you let me know :) )

- Be certain
    
- Cut the fluff - Delete all contextless words
    
- Use numeric values and explain the instances - Content without numbers doesn’t reflect expertise in Koray’s eyes - Instead of saying here are some ways to…., here are 5 ways to….
    
- Qualify Instances - Here are 5 techniques to kick a soccer ball etc - Be specific with what ur numeric value applies to (6 symptoms, 6 techniques etc) 
    
- Understand the context of verbs - Every verb is connected to and signals a different context (heavily related to Verbs of life article) 
    
- Give examples after a plural noun
    

Example - There are over 40 cryptocurrencies listed on Coinbase, such as Ethereum, Bitcoin and Litecoin. (Cryptocurrencies (plural noun) Ethereum, Bitcoin (Examples) 

- Use the same part of speech tag (word role) in the first word of a sentence for lists, e.g:
    

1. Ensure (Verb) + Noun
    
2. Clear (Verb) + Noun
    
3. Spend (Verb) + Noun
    
4. Absorb (Verb) + Noun
    

Tangible Advice - Use the same PoST (Part Of Speech Tag) for all sentences - Do the same with semantic role labels

- Optimise subordinate text (first sentence after headings) e.g:
    

1. Heading: How to do X…
    
2. Wrong Subordinate Text: X is…
    
3. Correct subordinate text: To do X…
    

Tangible Advice - Match the adjectives, predicates, noun order between questions and answers

  

- Put conditional “if” statements in the second part of the sentence
    

1. Wrong: “If A becomes B, do X.”
    
2. Correct: “Do X, if A becomes B.”
    

Tangible Advice - First declaration then the constraint

- Match anchor text with targeted web pages title.
    

1. Eg. targeted web page title: 10 ways to improve sleep efficiency
    
2. Possible anchor text: sleep efficiency
    

- Do not delay the answer 
    

1. Question - What are the benefits of vision boards for entrepreneurs 
    
2. Correct Answer - There are x main benefits of a vision board for an entrepreneur 
    

- If the page is about how to, don't give a definition
    
- Bold the answer not the search term - the bold part signals the answer part of to the search engine
    

not penguin, but flightless sea bird

- Be cheaper (in terms of cost of retrieval, also influenced by topical authority) - Cost of ranking a website can’t be higher than cost of not ranking a website.
    

  

Even if in theory your website is larger than your competitors, and requires more from google to crawl and index, as long as your website is responsive to as many queries as possible lowers retrieval costs for search engines, in net terms. Considering, your website/source is able to in theory satisfy all the queries within your particular domain rather than crawling 15,000 different websites for 15,000 different queries. 

  

Query Responsiveness - it is actually about giving the correct information to the search engine 

  

Information Retrieval - Is what all on site processes attempt to influence/impact 

- Query to document relevance
    
- Document to Query relevance
    
- Document to Document Similarity 
    
- Query To Query Similarity 
    

  
Information Extraction - Trying to understand sentence structures and give the highest possibility responsive answer at the earliest point.

- Query to question, and question and answer
    
- Focus on question and answer generation for IR (Initial ranking? Information Retrieval?)
    

  
Information Responsiveness - Koray’s Book Keywords to questions (k2q) about question generation - is involving the respective entity, attribute, value combinations with macro and micro content distribution across multiple SCN’s to prove overall quality and relevance of information. 

  

## Entity Identity Creation - 

If you can convince Google that ‘x is y but not z’  with semantics, it means that your topical map is a knowledge base. A website will only rank if they’re similar to you. 

  

Making competitors imitate us in order to rank for these entities. 

  

## LLMo optimization for SEO

1. Fine-tune LLM
    
2. Create a topical map
    
3. Create a semantic content network
    
4. Generate content
    
5. Include human effort
    
6. Improve your knowledge base
    
7. Make your website a speaking AI
    

  

- Find a knowledge base and verbalise it - A knowledge base that relates to your knowledge domain. In other words, it includes the facts and triples of the key entities within your industry/niche. Verbalise it with data to text and slowly 
    

- Use natural language inference with chain of reasoning
    

- Minimise the use of the expensive algorithms of google (be cheaper) 
    
- There are blacklisted and whitelisted words in LLM word usage - because different words are connected to each other within a large language model (LLM) 
    
- The watermarking patents apparently claim a 98% AI content detection success rate - due to the patterns in a LLM. 
    

  

The SEOs who understand will win over imitator

Google patent: Cross language information retrieval

Koray used coded topical graphs to demonstrate his thinking, the graphs show connections between topics for all the topics of the ranking pages

https:infranodus.com/

Language interpretation tool: https:pair-code.github.io/lit/

Check word compositionality and embeddings - The difference between the different word/sentence/context/heading vectors is actually the semantic difference between the two concepts, sentences or words, etc 

  

Background: [https:ai.googleblog.com/2020/11/the-language-interpretability-tool-lit.html](https:ai.googleblog.com/2020/11/the-language-interpretability-tool-lit.html)

Small qualitative differences on a sentence (or byte) level get multiplied and make a huge difference in the end

Sequence modelling (word compositionality modelling) is the backbone of semantic SEO and LLMO

E.g. what is the likelihood that predicates such as chase, eat, or fly appear with the word  “Cat”.

One of Koray’s internal training files on ‘Sensing search engines’:

  

Certain things can be connected to each other when looking at a particular topic, but when looking at a different topic, the topics that we’re previously connected don’t always match the topics that we’re matched when looking at the initial topic, even though in some sense they’re connected but only in the context of that topic.

- Internal Link Design is also used to direct internal linking between the different articles and pages. 
    
- Content briefs that contain topical maps, and the different briefs. Broken down into different continents, then countries under the continents - to understand the different query networks. 
    

1. You’d want to find the most popular entity within the query network - it is typically a country but differs based on niché 
    
2. Dive into lexical relations - If you’re able to rank for European visa, it’ll be easier to rank for german visa considering, germany is a part of europe. 
    
3. Then relating to semantic similarity and distance - what is the closest most relevant entity to germany - most people would use berlin (but it’s a city in germany) but it’s not the same type of entity (City ≠ Country), it’ll need to be another country that is the same entity type. People would geographically associate one, or multiple of the bordering nations would be the closest to Germany in a semantic sense. However, for google what is semantically closest to Germany, will be based upon user behaviour (google tries to imitate the real world as much as possible, so there is obviously some large correlation between the real world geography or as Koray puts it encyclopaedia of a country, and google’s understanding of the semantic distance between these two things.) However, in terms of google/semantics, the closest countries are; bulgaria, Turkey, and lithuania. 
    

  

## Steps or Tips To creating the topical map 

- Find the most popular entity type within the query networks
    
- And make the map based upon the attributes of the entity type - (repeat not a particular entity but the entity type - Country, City etc) 
    
- Take the attributes, and prioritise the topics (I assume based off the attributes (verbs will come in somewhere here :) )
    
- Establish your topical borders according to proximity between them
    

  

## Content Configuration Considerations/General Overview 

Inside the content configuration we are increasing relevance and query responsiveness to a particular topic, by adding some sections, removing others, and changing internal links, you’re configuring the content for higher relevance to the intended topic. 

  

## Metrics Used To Measure This - 

- How it ranks based on; 
    
- New queries
    
- Lost queries
    
- Shaved queries 
    
- According to that, certain sections are prioritised with each other. 
    
- Bulgaria and lithuania are always linked with Germany - based off search behaviour 
    

  

## [Entity and Attribute](https:docs.google.com/document/d/12Q3pyo7Q8lavyPrmlTBXCc1KRwOMcqrUneN8FAOdI2s/edit?fbclid=IwAR1vrmkA19RZFcZtpHcCdtASFE9qlyfA2Pl4TQkbO0QYNIz-VEVSTfR_UTo#heading=h.dgtpa7htrlle) Pairs 

- When creating a webpage for an entity attribute pair, if that web page ranks well, then it will probably happen for another entity from the same type. 
    
- That is why we use other entities from the same types based upon their mutual attributes 
    
- Even if you write for Germany, you will get impressions from bulgaria and lithuania, because of the Erasmus visa, because all the students from those regions search for that visa, and Germany from those different countries, google associates these countries as being related to one another, despite their not being much local proximity.  
    
- Adjust the topical map, and configure it better,
    
- Increase the relevance between these three countries, so that german related articles can rank for german related queries, lithuania articles for lithuania queries, and bulgaria articles for bulgaria queries, for their own country. 
    
- Internal links will be between them so they can support each other. 
    

  

# Lecture 2 - Introduction to Query Semantics

## Query semantics - 

Query Semantics Come from user behaviours and perception - they don’t come from dictionaries - Every word or search term actually takes their meaning and relevance (in a search engine) based upon the search queries of users (user behaviour). Hence, Lithuania and Germany despite not being close to one another, are related, and relevant in the eyes of the search engine when it comes to visa’s because of users' search behaviour. 

## Only 3 Things Can Be Clustered - Also with different variations - 

1. Queries - (Query to document) (query to user etc) (Query to Query (AKA query clustering))
    
2. Documents
    
3. Users  
    

Matching queries to topics & entities, topics and entities to documents, and then documents to users

## Three Key Concepts - Correlative Queries, Sequential Queries, and Query Paths

Worked Example - Let’s call three different queries - Q1, Q2 and Q3 

1. Correlative Queries - correlative Queries Which query has been searched with the other 
    

Example -  In other words the order doesn’t matter (For this concept), it’s a matter of how many times Q1, Q2, and Q3 are searched together within one search session, and the overall numerical correlation, of how many times these Queries are searched together. Allowing google to understand if the queries are related if there is a high correlation among a large group of users search behaviour. 

2. Query Path - refers to the order in which your search queries. Or the sequential journey of a user in terms of their search queries. 
    

Example - If I search Q1 and Q3, My query path is Q1 then Q3

3. Sequential Queries - Looks at different search sessions of the same user, and looks at the different queries across 2 search sessions (Even though it’s probably more then 2, but 2 is to keep it simple), and checks if the queries in these sessions match the same search context, or user state, they ignore other queries and cluster the queries that are from same context together. 
    

## Extra notes -

- How Google clusters users, and their search behaviours, along with the entities in those search behaviours, and context of those queries will determine which queries are related to what, what borders will exist between topics (topical borders). 
    
- Semantic Distance between different topics will change for each and every broad core algorithm update.
    
- In our topical maps we tend to go broader in order to stay safe from Broad Core Algorithms, How google clusters users in conjunction with search behaviours.
    

  
  

# Lecture 3 - Introduction to Real Topical Maps (TM)

## Topical Maps 

Topical Maps are created not just to imitate or mimic other sources, with a topical map you’re altering the search engines perception of a particular topic, and become an actual authority - because if all you do is imitate, and copy, how can you be an authority/leader in your industry/niché.

## There are 5 concepts that make a topical map - 

1. Raw Topical Map
    
2. Processed Topical Map - Macro Context - [Title Tag Writing Methodologies](https:docs.google.com/document/d/12Q3pyo7Q8lavyPrmlTBXCc1KRwOMcqrUneN8FAOdI2s/edit?fbclid=IwAR1vrmkA19RZFcZtpHcCdtASFE9qlyfA2Pl4TQkbO0QYNIz-VEVSTfR_UTo#heading=h.lzn3hm60p0im) 
    
3. URL - Information Tree
    
4. Description - Summarisation, context and topical terms are included here for the topic.
    
5. Image URL 
    
6. Image Alt Text 
    
7. Publication date 
    

Extra’s

8. Checklist - Whether it has been published
    
9. Notes - Extra details or considerations
    

## 3 main principles for TA 

If you can’t go wider, you must go deeper, if you can’t go deeper you must go faster

1. Vastness - Wider - Wide topical map while connecting everything together, 
    
2. Depth - Deeper - Going deeper for a specific attribute and the context (source)
    
3. Momentum - Faster - Publish more on the specific context, for all the entities from same type
    

## The topical map looks at Entity and Attribute Pairs 

We’re choosing only certain types of attributes for processing the entities - Not every article in a semantic content network or topical map needs to be of the utmost quality, but there need to be quality nodes (most important articles, keep them linked on your homepage and therefore closer to the crawlers) there are parts of the TM that aren’t necessarily important. The way you determine the importance of the (and main) attributes is based on your source context.  
  

## Two Parts Of A Topical Map 

1. Outer Section - Consists of the more wider/vast approach, and are the parts of the topical map that are less important. Less in terms of the depth of the particular topic. 
    
2. Core Section - Is for going deeper based on the specific type of attribute, associated with an entity type.  - Source Context + Central Entity = Core Section (Germany Visa in the example)
    
3. Example - The outer section covers topics like; life in germany, Germany Politics, Germany Religion, Germany Crime Rate. We are looking at these topics very briefly, and aren’t going into particular areas of these topics.  The core section is used for going deeper on the particular attribute of Visas, which is also related to the source context of that website (visa consultancy). Therefore, they discuss all the different types of visas, which I believe would be the values. Entity Is Germany - Attribute is Visa’s - Values are the different types of Visas (C Type, D Type Etc). Then their other local aspects covered as well, like the 
    
4. Source Context - How we make money or monetise with our website/business 
    

  

## Fundamental Aspects Of The Topical Map

- A central entity must be chosen for the Topical Map (TM) and Semantic Content Network (SCN) - It appears in all the articles and is the invariable part (meaning it doesn’t change) of the TM and SCN. 
    
- A source context must also be chosen (or understood) - Source context is basically who you are, how you make money and your brand identity. You will need to create a logical contextual bridge between that entity, and your source context.  
    

# Lecture 4 - Topical Map Components (Revisit)

## Central Search Intent - 

- Combine your source context, and central entity, and you can get your central search intent (some general understanding of it) (Source Context x Central Entity = Central Search Intent). Augment it/Deepen/Sharpen the search intent. 
    
- You must understand [Correlative Queries](https:docs.google.com/document/d/12Q3pyo7Q8lavyPrmlTBXCc1KRwOMcqrUneN8FAOdI2s/edit?fbclid=IwAR1vrmkA19RZFcZtpHcCdtASFE9qlyfA2Pl4TQkbO0QYNIz-VEVSTfR_UTo#heading=h.e3m79fputq02), and [Sequential queries](https:docs.google.com/document/d/12Q3pyo7Q8lavyPrmlTBXCc1KRwOMcqrUneN8FAOdI2s/edit?fbclid=IwAR1vrmkA19RZFcZtpHcCdtASFE9qlyfA2Pl4TQkbO0QYNIz-VEVSTfR_UTo#heading=h.e3m79fputq02), to understand that a query about visa is one step in a 100m race (implying there are more steps before completing the race). In more technical terms, a search about visa’s is related to a variety of other queries (corollary queries) (before, and after it) in a particular type of search behaviour.  Obtaining/taking a visa is one part of a larger journey of visiting, or learning about germany. This is also typical with other things like shopping for Suit shoes, which would be accompanied (theoretically) by searches for pants, shirts, ties, socks etc. Ultimately, the central search intent would be more general than the one individual level (of shoes) and is the overall journey of looking for an outfit. 
    
- What is the main intent of a particular set of queries (determined by search behaviour of the particular user group). Not what is the intent of one individual query but the whole journey of them. 
    
- Macro context for the entire topical map can be generated from, central search intent. If you can understand the associated predicates (Verbs) and prepositions (words like; in,around) then you can create the macro context of TM. We can shape the central search intent around the predicates, propositions and central entity. 
    
- Example Used By Koray - Visiting,Knowing,Learning, Travelling, Living, in/to/for/around Germany. 
    
- Shortened to know and Go Germany - Entails all of the predicates with the central entity
    
- Like the central entity, central search intent must be included in every content brief, webpage, website especially in the (Top part) main content.
    
- One of the predicates will always be included the top of the main content with an internal linking
    

1. Title Tag
    
2. Introduction Areas
    
3. Heading’s 
    

- This should be done to ensure we create similar context vectors
    

What is the main intent of a particular set of queries (determined by search behaviour). Not what is the intent of one individual query. 

## How Central Search Intent Impacts The Core and Outer Part Of The TM

- Core Section - Only focuses on the monetization aspect of how a source makes money in relation to its central entity. The core section is the connection of the source context with the main/central entity. 
    
- Outer Section - Is to not discuss the way a source monetises (Visa consultancy) - is unification with one. Unification of the central entity with one of the predicates (in the example it’s with the predicate know) will also be mainly linking to the core section (and outer parts of the outer section), for better and higher historical data, getting more sessions and queries, and proving that we are more relevant to a particular query.
    
- The Central Entity is also an independent part, and doesn’t belong to the core or outer part section.
    

## Why do we cover the outer section?

When you cover the outer section, we are briefly touching on particular attributes of the central entity. If we are able to provide more information for the attributes in the outer section and the possible contexts that can arise.

- Enough level of expertise
    
- Accuracy 
    
- Unique information
    
- Consistent quality increase
    
- Google’s search engine will increase our sources' context (contextual relevance) to the central entity in terms of relevance. Meaning we will be able to rank higher for the visa section as well.
    

  

## Steps To A Semantic Content Network

1. Focus on an entity type 
    
2. Create a topical map 
    
3. Integrate with the other entities 
    
4. Connect and associate everything together
    

  

# Lecture 5 - Central Entity, Central Search Intent, and Site-wide Ngrams

## Reviewing Past Lectures - 

- Central entity - will be appearing in all the articles and site wide 
    
- Central search intent - Will also be appearing along the whole website
    
- Central entity + Central Search Intent = Site Wide N Grams and Phrases - indicating to the search engine the main topic of the website. 
    
- Higher quality nodes should be closer to the homepage and are typically from the core section of the topical map; not all parts of the TM must be quality. 
    
- Outer section is for higher historical data (more user sessions), and topical relevance, it doesn’t come from the source context, but from the central entity, and part of the central search intent (one verb).
    
- Core section is directly for monetisation and from the source context and central search entity unification. 
    

## Considerations For The Connection Of The Outer and Core Sections

- The outer section of the TM is connected to the particular aspects of the core. The outer section is created through the most important attribute. The outer section of the TM is for the attributes of the central entity, but they must be connected (internally linked) to the core section, and to parts of the outer section. 
    
- The most important part of the outer section will be from the most important attribute - Known as the attribute and context hierarchy, the most important attribute at the top to create higher relevance.
    
- According to the most important node in the core section (in this example it’s visa type), will need to adjust the order of the attributes of the outer section to ensure greater relevance for the most important nodes in the core section. Considering, different attributes will be more relevant or important to different parts of the core section. For example, touching on German drinks, and cuisine will be more important for a tourist visa, then German universities or language schools will be for student visas. 
    

  
  

# Lecture 6 - Processed and Raw Topical Maps (Macro - Micro Contexts) 

## Processed Topical Maps (Entity-Attribute Pairs) 

Title tags are the processed and verbalised versions/expressions of (central) entity-attribute pairs (Germany Politics etc). Every single entity attribute pair, and title tag, should only have one macro context, one focus, and one web page for that specific context and entity-attribute pair (don’t dilute). Each of these specific pages with a macro context will also have a micro context section, which will contain slightly different things, and these slightly different things need to be able to connect to our source context, central entity, and central search intent.

## Different Title Tag Writing Methodologies (Expanded In [Other Lectures](https:docs.google.com/document/d/12Q3pyo7Q8lavyPrmlTBXCc1KRwOMcqrUneN8FAOdI2s/edit?fbclid=IwAR1vrmkA19RZFcZtpHcCdtASFE9qlyfA2Pl4TQkbO0QYNIz-VEVSTfR_UTo#heading=h.oim1v534rc2j)) 

1. Using a conjunctive word (and, for, whereas), with two conditional synonyms (religion and belief)
    

- The word ‘and’ indicates you are a using conditional synonym phrase (for example cost and conditions, typically not synonyms but in this context they’re)
    
- Germany crime rate and safe cities - Crime rate is related to the word safe (antonym) - This is also used to be able to connect back to the source context, where the safest cities can be linked back to particular visa types (Ie; Living in germany, studying etc) 
    

2.  Using an entity-attribute pair (which is its own entity) in the heading then using two of the attributes of the attribute in the entity attribute pair. 
    

- For example - Famous German Singers, Their works and achievements
    
- If you use a plural word with a noun like singers - it expresses a set - with many individual instances of the entity. In Other Words, using a plural noun, indicates there are going to be multiple different entities underneath the umbrella of the plural entity (hypernyms) 
    

3. You can use a combination of the two - somewhat - 
    

- For example - Entity Attribute Pair Was - German Literature - Processed heading - German Writers, Their Works and German Literature.
    
- The purpose for this, I believe is because German Literature (which is the entity attribute pair) all have authors/writers. An author will be included in every single piece of literature talked about, so therefore, it’s natural and perhaps even makes more sense to discuss the author (Especially if they have multiple pieces of famous literature, which tends to happen). In this instance literature is a synonym for works. 
    

4. Utilising an entity attribute pair with a hypernym and using the hyponyms after a colon
    

- For example - Entity attribute pair - German + Celebrity - German Celebrities: Famous Authors, Poets, Actors and Musicians 
    
- Celebrity is a hypernym of Author,poets, actors and musicians, as they can be celebrities 
    

  

## What Search Engines Can Do With Your Title Tags? 

- Google can aggregate all your title tags terms together, and understand your topicality through which words appear the most in them. 
    
- Hence, there is a repetition of certain words in the title tags - from the core section of the TM 
    
- Example - Visa, Application, Fee, Documents, Requirements, Entry, Tourist or apply or getting and other contextual terms in this area.
    
- Topical entries typically represent the overall topicality, the contextual terms reflect what way a particular attribute is processed.
    

  

# Lecture 7 - Topic Distillation with Information Architecture

# Rules and Methodologies For Writing URLs 

- Don’t repeat the same words within a URL
    
- No more than 2 words in one bracket.
    
- If the word is used twice, for different URLs, it is for an internal link.
    
- For Example - Germany/Visa/Culture and Germany/Life/Culture - Both are internally linked to one another.
    
- The most important attribute for the outer section (in this case ‘life’) is to the top, and is a priority.
    
- Other attributes like culture, are processed in the context of the main attribute of life and the same with religion.
    
- According to our source context, central search intent, and core section of the TM, We must be able to prioritise what should be coming/connected where exactly.  
    

  

## How URLs Are Understood, and Crawled/Examined By Google

Related to subsite retrieval, If we want to process and retrieve particular information from this url breakdown/part, the information of this subject (Culture,Religion, Life) will come in the context of the particular central entity (Germany in this case). 

  

URLs are the first thing that search engine crawlers look at, and can decide whether they want to crawl them or not. Basically, if they’re logical, reflect the main topic, and connect to each other with our source context, they will provide a better initial ranking (Minor). - I assume the crawlers decide whether they would want to crawl a particular section. 

  

If you’re able to provide a proper contextual crawl path, and if the outer and core section of the topical map is connected properly, the words they see will be united, processed and complete in the context of life and germany, and they will understand the main topic here (Life in germany), if they find Life and Germany to be quality enough they will crawl, the other corresponding extensions of the URL (Germany/Life/Culture - Considering Germany/Life is quality). 

  

As it pertains to the outer section of the topical map, URL structure (X/Y/Z) will be deeper (Germany/Life/Culture/Religion). Relative to the core section, which is much ‘flatter’. (German/Visa - German/Visa/Student). 

  

In the core section everything comes under Visa (source context main topic), while in the outer section most things come under life. Life will be linking to the visa, and all the nodes/articles underneath will also be linking to the visa. You actually create two sub sections which are connected back to the root. 

  

## The 3 levels of a A Semantic Content Network Hierarchy - Root, Seed and Node

Within a SCN, we are utilising both ontology, and taxonomy. Unlike Silo’s or Hub pages, which only utilise one of them. 

1. Root - The root is what everything (seeds and nodes) will link back to, and it is also what is linked to the homepage.
    
2. Seed - is a sub categorisation of the root, and is broken down into two sections (in the example)
    
3. Nodes -  Are a further breakdown of the seed, into individual articles or pages, and each section is connected back one (Nodes To Seed, and, Seed To Node, Root to Seed, and Seed to Root.)
    

  

According to the url structure, and the information tree the relevance of each attribute to their entities will be changing. 

  
For example if religion is taken from under culture (Germany/life/Culture/Religion) and placed underneath politics (Germany/life/politics/Religion), the relevance will change, and will require that religion is processed in the context of politics, might result in a political issue, related to religion being processed rather than something else. Considering, we are reflecting our overall macro context in our title tags, our url structure can change in relation to them. In this case if religion is to change under politics, the title tag would have to change to something like religion effect on politics, or political parties, or religion political parties in Germany, or even religion's effect on the election, From Religion and Belief Structure In Germany.

  
  
  
  
  

# Lecture 8 - Context Signals in Title Tags and Descriptions

## Meta Descriptions

- Meta Descriptions aren’t ranking factors,
    
- They should reflect your overall topicality
    
- Search engines perceive your meta descriptions as summaries of your article/webpage.
    

  

## Koray’s use of Meta Descriptions

- Koray repeats his titles with slightly different versions and expands upon them.
    
- The order of the document is reflected in the order of the meta description.
    
- If I have heading 1,2 and 3, in that order, My meta description will be in order 1,2 and 3. 
    
- The best way to communicate with the search engine with a complex adaptive system - is to create a pattern/template and make the search engine recognise that pattern by doing it consistently.
    
- The same way we use the supplementary content (the end of the article) to link to our core section and source context. The same way it will be listed at the end.
    
- Whatever we process in our title tag, we expand it then place our micro context within it. Then touch on our micro context within the description
    
- The breakdown of German Job Opportunities, into its own URL structure and article, is because there is significant competition in this particular area, and in order for it to be competitive there must be another semantic content network deployed. This because if the node isn’t successful, it won't affect the other two structures of Germany/Life and Germany/Visa
    

  

# Lecture 9 - Macro-Micro Context with Main and Supplementary Content

## Three Types Of Content In A Document

1. Main Content
    
2. Supplementary Content
    
3. Ads
    

## Macro Context - Main Topic

- Most of the document has to be about your macro context
    
- Main Content will come with a macro context from our title tag
    
- After A Certain number of headings you will realise you are beginning to talk about something else (Supplementary content). 
    

  

## Process Of Reaching Your Main Content, and Macro Context - 

Topical Map Node > Title Tag > Description > Contextual Vector in the form of Headings (H1,H2,H3 etc) > Then we draw a line or distinction based on a particular heading that shifts from main to supplementary content > Create our internal links

  

Contextual vectors are displayed and established in the form of headings.

Each node has one macro context and main section, and the micro context inside the supplementary context is always diverse, and changing.

## Connecting Main and Supplementary Content

- In the main content we will discuss our macro context (main topic of the webpage), and in logical semantic manner, the headings will descend into the supplementary context, as each heading has its own micro context, and is gradually changing what you’re talking about. Until we can start linking back to the source context
    
- The Example - The H1 - Safest cities in Germany (macro context) - considering the word is a plural noun, this will be a ranked entity list, create a listicle as headings and give the safest cities with tables, and comparisons of them for each section. When it comes to supplementary content, we can’t talk about the macro context (already been covered), we can talk about something else still within the context of the document and the macro context, but something that is connected to the source context from our topical map. 
    
- In the supplementary context, we might talk about the most crowded, most dense, the highest traffic or crime rate.
    
- Koray typically uses an antonym, (the opposite of a word) of safety, which could be the most dangerous cities in Germany, while staying in the same entity line, and same topic. If you use an antonym, you will be increasing overall relevance.
    
- When creating this type of supplementary content (antonym), it means we will be creating an internal link, to a different node/article, that will have the macro context of the dangerous cities in Germany, while the supplementary content that reflects the micro context of this article will link back to the other article.
    

## Additional Points

- If there is no search demand on a high enough level, or candidate documents with enough level of authority > Don’t create a new webpage for a macro context.
    
- To be able to create a new web page, we need to see if that specific context vector, and domain needs a new index construction
    
- If there is no need for a webpage, it should be included on the same page, and according to the topical map, it will need to go to another page or context.
    

# Lecture 10 - Context Specification with IR Zones

## Image Alt Tags and URLs

- Alt Tags, and URLS are used to reflect overall topicality, and contextuality better, to increase relevance.
    
- Whatever is included in the web page title,url and description, it is expanded and varies further upon in the alt tags and urls.
    
- If there is certain vocab or words not used before will be used in them
    
- The image urls might be slightly bigger than other urls, with phrases or multiple words in them (no more than 3 words typically)
    
- Shorter URLs = Cost Advantage for search engines (because they easier to process)
    
- If there are two duplicate pages, google will take the one with the shorter URL, as the canonical one.
    
- Shorter URLs are easier for search engines to augment, verbalise and understand the main context of the url.
    
- Alt tags should be an expansion or variation of the image URL
    
- They can also be used to reduce word proximity between corresponding words with one another (Like cost and Germany in Koray’s example), if they are too far from one another in the other sections (title tag, description etc) 
    
- When it comes to the core section, Koray tries to use some context enriching terms along with the main terms that signal topicality
    
- Alt tags are typically longer, and in the headline or featured image Koray doesn’t use sentences, typically uses conjunctions with context terms
    
- The objects at the centre of the image should be included in the alt tag, the objects in the outer part are less important
    
- For example 
    

1. Image URL - German Climate 
    
2. Alt Tag - Germany Climate and Vegetation 
    

  

# ​​Lecture 11 - Publication and Refreshment Frequency

## Publication Frequency 

- Momentum Comes From Publication Frequency - 
    
- Publication Date - Reflects when each article will be published
    

## Rules For Publication Frequency

1. Be patternless. The search engine shouldn’t know when we are publishing our articles. One day publish multiple articles, the next only one, then don’t publish, then post one. Sometimes in the morning, late at night, midday. Ensure there is no pattern and no regular frequency
    
2. If you take a timeline, we should be the source that publishes the most across this timeline. 
    
3. Don’t publish during core algorithm updates, or big algorithmic changes. Publish during a ‘flat’ algorithmic season, where google is looking to find new documents and improve their main index quality
    
4. The main purpose is to take search engine attention, and to also reduce the cost of the search engine crawling (overall) 
    

  

## Example - 

- If a search engine spends money to crawl our website in the particular knowledge domain with numerous sources
    
- Being a ‘new source’, to outrank some of the sources, we must have higher relevance, higher responsiveness, better coverage, and better depth (better overall quality) 
    
- To prove the above section, we will need the attention of the search engine crawlers. 
    
- If we are crawled more than our competitors, it means google has invested money and time in us. If they crawl us more, and the information related to the website is fresher, compared to our competitors, they will need to try our website/web pages (To gain historical data) .
    
- Whenever they crawl, they see new content,  the new content is clearer, more accurate and comprehensiveness is higher 
    
- They’ll realise that ranking us is cheaper, relative to our competitors. This touches on the core concept of Topical Authority, The cost of ranking our website must be cheaper then the cost of not ranking our website
    

  

## Considerations

- If they go through our whole website, and they don’t find anything of quality. They won’t come back for 8 months or 2 core algorithm updates (long time)
    
- Higher discipline is required - Everything must be ready for when get the attention from the search engine
    
- Higher Crawl Rate is typically correlated with positive search rankings
    
- The climbs or peaks in our traffic is a result of reranking. Each re-ranking gives us a greater rankability
    
- In each Broad Core Algorithm Update, there is a box with minimum and maximum threshold of traffic, each source is placed into. With each BCAU you can go into a superior or inferior box. Superior boxes have higher traffic thresholds, and inferior boxes have lower traffic thresholds
    
- The way to increase the box you are in is to gather enough historical data, and comprehensively (high level accuracy and clarity) after a BCAU the rankings will soar, and there are new thresholds.
    
- We are being patternless, and creating differences so the crawlers will have to always crawl our website and will always find increased quality. The more quality thresholds we exceed the higher continuous ranking we are able to attain.

#  Lecture 14 - Koray's FrameWork (Context is Everything) - General Overview

## Content Brief ‘Anatomy’ - When it comes to semantics, everything comes back to context

1. Contextual Vector - Headings
    
2. Contextual Hierarchy - Headings Level
    
3. Contextual Structure - Prompts for the authors
    
4. Contextual Connection - Are the internal links and anchor texts 
    

  

## Overview Of Koray’s Process For His Content Brief’s - ll

1. Takes all the search query terms for the central entity 
    
2. From them he generates questions (related to the contextual Vector)
    
3. Then he prioritises/orders them (attribute filtration)
    
4. Hierarchy for the questions/headings (Contextual Hierarchy) 
    
5. Then a structure for each answer (Contextual Structure) - Explaining how the questions should be answered (the format) - Table (Row Count, Column Count, Column name and order, List (sentence before, and after the list), The image design, Alt tag, what kind of statistics and how many statistics - This also applies to E - Commerce as well
    

  

## Expansion Of The Anatomy 

1. Contextual Vector - The first heading is connected to the last heading with a proper order (Prioritisation) 
    
2. Contextual Hierarchy
    
3. Contextual Structure
    
4. Contextual Connection - Are the internal links and anchor texts - In Koray’s Methodology the most important anchor text is in the [root](https:docs.google.com/document/d/12Q3pyo7Q8lavyPrmlTBXCc1KRwOMcqrUneN8FAOdI2s/edit?fbclid=IwAR1vrmkA19RZFcZtpHcCdtASFE9qlyfA2Pl4TQkbO0QYNIz-VEVSTfR_UTo#heading=h.3c0sy8fpo9j). The root article is connected to the most important nodes, and seeds, and they all link back to this root article. According to the connections there are different internal link prioritizations. 
    

- The purpose for Koray linking to the countries in Europe article first, is because all the countries related root articles will link to europe (the ones that are in europe). Then the europe section will link to the rest of the world. 
    
- The bottom part/supplementary content, and less relevant micro contexts, are where Koray places the bulk of his internal links, and he doesn’t use boilerplate internal links. 
    
- There are less links in the main content for two purposes: One is so that more relevance, and page rank is passed through, and so the more important web pages receive these larger boosts
    
- Also According to the different heading (H1,H2,H3) there will be more or less relevance passed through these headings (H1>H2>H3, in terms of page rank and relevance passed through these internal links).  
    

  

## Colour Codes Koray - 

A  - Can also serve as a reminder to remember to insert the link

1. Might signal the article isn’t ready yet but the internal link is placed 
    
2. Skipped For Now 
    

  

# Lecture 15 - Contextual and Knowledge Domains

  

The entire anatomy of a content brief, stems from the query terms. Without understanding how search engines, read,process, understand, associate, and cluster the search terms and queries. 

Related Powerpoint - [https:www.slideshare.net/KorayGbr/semantic-search-engine-semantic-search-and-query-parsing-with-phrases-and-entities](https:www.slideshare.net/KorayGbr/semantic-search-engine-semantic-search-and-query-parsing-with-phrases-and-entities)

  

## Theory Of Connecting Contextual and Knowledge domains (Example) -

If your website is in one knowledge domain (let’s call it knowledge domain 1), and you want to expand it to another domain knowledge domain (knowledge domain 6), you will need to create a vector, that touches through some minor knowledge domains, and perhaps a larger knowledge domain, this is called your ‘semantic path’. The distance between knowledge domain 1 and 6 is the semantic distance, and will shape the topical map. 

  

Different types of knowledge domains are united under different types of contextual domains, because two different things can come closer together (less semantic distance), with certain types of entities, attributes, contexts, and different types of purposes. Once getting the knowledge domains we will need to connect them with the context.

  

## Process Of Generating The Content Brief

1. We must get all the queries related to our central entity
    
2. To be able to get the other parts of the content brief - We must [process/filter](https:docs.google.com/document/d/12Q3pyo7Q8lavyPrmlTBXCc1KRwOMcqrUneN8FAOdI2s/edit?fbclid=IwAR1vrmkA19RZFcZtpHcCdtASFE9qlyfA2Pl4TQkbO0QYNIz-VEVSTfR_UTo#heading=h.drxs676wca7d) the query, but more specifically the attributes. - To increase the important attributes overall relevance, in the contextual vectors to increase/improve overall relevance
    

  

# Lecture 16 - Attribute Filtration and Criterias - Related to EAV

## Three Criteria For Filtration 

1. Attribute Prominence - Comes from the definition of the entity. In other words if you aren’t able to define an entity without that attribute. Makes the attribute incredibly important for the entity, and therefore highly prominent
    

- For Example - The entity type of a country, can’t be defined without a population (people), therefore the population of a country is highly prominent to an entity that’s a country 
    
- Another example is protein powder without the attribute of protein (it’s just powder 😂), making protein, and different types of protein highly prominent. 
    

2. Attribute Popularity - Popularity is a result of search demand/volume. Basically, when it’s popular attribute, it’s connected to the entity with certain types of references (phrases) 
    
3. Attribute Relevance - It’s a matter of how relevant the attribute is to your source context, not your central entity type. 
    

  

## Worked Example 

- The German League isn’t prominent (Germany still exists without it’s soccer/football league), it is popular (High search demand), and isn’t relevant (Doesn’t really connect to the visa source context)
    
- Population Ticks All The boxes, and is processed directly as a node, and is verbalised under the life and the culture and different types of visas. It is the first and primary attribute for creating the root article. 
    

  

# Lecture 17 - Root of Semantic Content Network

## Contextual Vector 

- The root (of the entire semantic network) article is ‘special’, considering it’s connected to every single attribute, and every other attribute related document is related back to this document. 
    
- The first heading is crucial - The example is What to [know before going](https:docs.google.com/document/d/12Q3pyo7Q8lavyPrmlTBXCc1KRwOMcqrUneN8FAOdI2s/edit?fbclid=IwAR1vrmkA19RZFcZtpHcCdtASFE9qlyfA2Pl4TQkbO0QYNIz-VEVSTfR_UTo#heading=h.2fj202azgpvx) to Germany
    
- The central search intent chosen must be expressed in the root document, when the root document has that specific search intent, it will be able to create the rest of the contextual vector in a proper way. 
    
- The more important attributes for a central entity, based upon the filtration of attributes, the higher up it is in the article. The lower it is in the article the less important it is
    
- The first heading, and especially the first heading in the root document, will be able to be connected to the rest of the documents and expressed in the rest of the heading vectors.
    
- Central Search Intent + H1 = Macro Context and Main content part
    
- Allowing for us distribute/hierarchy organise the attributes, and the contextual connections
    
- A contextual hint direction is given in the contextual structure based on the H1, to tell authors how to answer these headings or questions, and connect to the next headings.
    
- The first heading is the most important, especially in a root document. If you create a bad, less relevant or less responsive, distracted root document, any other document that is linked from here will be less relevant
    
- Considering, the central entity is the root of the URL structure/information tree, and is processed with all the attributes inside the root document. If the root of the information tree/root article is determined by google to be insufficient in quality, then they want to crawl further into the information tree of that root (Germany).
    

  

# Lecture 18 - Contextual Vector and Question Generation

## Why We Use Questions In Our Context Vectors - 

- Also known as the question vector, the reason for using questions, as much as possible, is to help the search engine to understand the particular question format (because create questions from the different sections of your content), and possible answer format. 
    
- This means we are using question, and answer pairs. If the question we are using, and is the most likely question the search engine will be generating from our content, and ranking at the top as a candidate question meaning they can learn the topic from us. 
    
- If we always use the questions, it stops the search engines from having to generate the questions on its own. Making the content more clear and easier to process.
    
- Instead of writing, where is Germany, if we write ‘Germany’ ‘Location Of Germany’, ‘coordinates of Germany’, the search engine will need to generate the question by looking at the answer, and creating possible questions (not certain). If we give it directly, it will be easier for responsiveness, and question and answer pairs. 
    
- When generating a question we need to understand which internal link will be used first in the questions.
    
- Example - Since all the articles in Europe will connect back to the article for europe, this is the same with the German root article, that will be the first and most important link, there will need to be a question related to the continent of germany or location to insert the internal link. 
    
- ‘What Continent Germany is in’ is a Synonym phrase for europe, what ever entity used inside the internal link, is mentioned in a synonym phrase in the corresponding heading/question
    
- The purpose for Koray asking where Germany is in a H2, then what continent is Germany in a H3, and giving the answer in the H3, is because in the H2 there are numerous more answers for the H2. The H3 is more specific to the answer given, and has a reduced number of answers, and you are also reducing the prominence of the link, and the relevance, and pagerank, allowing to pass more relevance, and Page rank to other internal links in the main content area.
    
- The question of Germany’s coordinates is given in a h3 underneath the h2 of the german population. Making the coordinates answer given in the context of the population, in other words, to distribute the population of Germany based on the coordinates, to expand the population context a bit further.
    

  

## Contextual Flow -

- Contextual Flow is the order in which contexts are processed. Contextual flow is keeping the contextual vector straight in one piece, that makes logical sense, with the whole thing flowing in a straight line, and every contextual domain that is chosen has a proper flow. Nearly every contextual domain has two headings.
    
- Example -  where is Germany, What continent is Germany in, What is Germany’s population, What Are Germany Coordinates, What Is Germany Time Zone, other questions are also asked.
    
- Then there is a descriptive question (What is the area of Germany) added to complete the other contextual domains. 
    

  

# Lecture 19 - Root, Rare, Unique Attributes for Question Generation

## Different Attributes For Entity Types

1. Root Attributes - are attributes that Appear in all of the instances of that entity class or type. 
    

- Example - City - Population, Area, Mayor (Political Party, Name, Personality etc), Parks, Business Centers, Demographics etc.
    

2. Rare Attributes - They don’t appear in every instance of that entity type, and they are certain types of features that only appear for certain entities. 
    

-  Nuclear Plants, Beaches, Forrests, Rivers, historical sites
    

3. Unique Attributes - Are certain types of features that appear only for that specific entity
    

- The Eiffel tower for paris, The Eureka Skydeck for Melbourne
    

## Order to process them - To create higher relevance process

1. Process the Unique attributes first, - it will be a qualifier or definitive measure, or feature for that entity, it will be like using a synonym for that entity or other name for that entity 
    
2. Root - Use them for providing accuracy and comprehensiveness, 
    
3. Rare - For qualifying and signifying the entity in a more comprehensive manner
    

## 4 Main Types of questions 

1. Boolean Questions - You can typically answer them with a yes or no answer
    

- Does Istanbul have parks?
    

2. Definitional Questions - They typically start with a what, and in this case they try to define a particular area. 
    

- What is the most crowded area of Istanbul?
    

3. Grouping Questions - Usually are multiple instances from the same type of entity,  with a context. 
    

- What are the historical sites of Istanbul?
    

4. Comparative Questions - A comparative or superlative word is used in the question in relation to an entity or entities. 
    

- What are the most crowded areas of Istanbul? 
    

## Their application in the content briefs

- Boolean questions are typically at the bottom or mid parts, and can be used to expand a previous questions context, where necessary
    
- Based on the questions in the Context vector, at the end of every section in the contextual structure we give a signal or signifer for the next header.
    
- The H1 is made up of all the H2’s all together and unified should explain the H1
    
- If there is a H3, underneath a H2, there needs to be a contextual bridge from the H2 to the H3
    
- According to the order of the definitional, or contextual opening, then we define and give the answer, then make an intro for the next heading. 
    
- It allows for the protection of the proximity between different terms as well. 
    

  

# Lecture 20 - Question Generation, Ranking and Canonicalization

## Steps To Help Generate Questions

1. Understand what types of words can appear next to or near the entity 
    

- Types, Style, Problems, Relationships
    

2. Expand upon the different types of potential words that can appear next to the entity
    

- Types - Bad Friendships, Good Friendships, Eternal Friendships, Friendship examples from history, moods of friendship etc
    
- We can be more specific with the context - Friendship types in business places, Friendship in sport 
    

3. We can then generate questions for the entity and related attributes
    
4. We must then understand what question is the highest rank for that particular question 
    

For example - We must understand out of these questions that are asking the same thing which of them has been ranked the highest by google - By checking the SERP - In this case the first Question is the best question 

- What is the definition of friendship
    
- What is Friendship 
    
- What does friendship mean in the dictionary
    
- What is the meaning of friendship - This question can also signal the purpose of friendship
    

5. The best question generated is known as a representative question
    
6. Then go deeper with a specific context question from the representative question
    

Examples - Going deeper for certain contextual vectors - 

- What is the second definition
    
- What is the definition of friendship in childhood? - 
    

7. According to the query network we target, we will need to generate more relevant questions to the query group and expand our answers further and further
    

## Extra Tips

- When we as an SEO, don’t have a significant amount of knowledge about the particular knowledge domain, we must train the search engine for the questions we are generating
    
- A question can be asked in an endless number of ways
    
- The shortest question is typically better, then just fix the grammar as an expert
    

## Example - 

1. What is the definition of friendship
    
2. What is Friendship
    
3. What does friendship mean in the dictionary
    
4. What is the meaning of friendship - This question can also signal the purpose of friendship
    

  

# Lecture 21 - Contextual Structure

## Contextual Structure -

We tell authors what they should be writing and in what format. We are providing a logical flow, with the relevant and key points for sufficiently, and efficiently processing a heading in the contextual vector.

- When we put something in the contextual structure, do they spend money?
    
- Our purpose isn’t to write the best article ever, it is to be better than our competitors
    
- In order to proceed in a cost effective manner.
    
- Besides choosing the attributes processed in the article in a certain order, we must also give the format, phrases, or list, or the sentence before and after the list (And order for the specific list), for each individual heading in the contextual vector
    
- Necessities should also be given - Things like numerical values (celcius, cm, mm), particular entities, certain dates etc
    
- Within particular headings that we don’t want to expand their relevance within the context vector within the content, we can process the heading, and go slightly further by asking a proceeding question to the representative question in the heading. Not by asking it directly but rather answering it in the section.
    
- Inquisitive Semantics - Means to give an answer then, ask another question.
    

  

## The Contextual Structure Example For The H1 - 

The definition of Germany should be made. Its population, Location, names of neighbouring countries, the official name of the country, the capital city, the form of government should be conveyed. 

- The purpose for touching on the population (attribute) first, is because it is the most important attribute for us in this context, and it’ll need to be connected to location because it is related to our anchor texts.
    

  
  

# ​​Lecture 22 - Contextual Coverage and Contextual Flow - Important (Revisit later) 

Contextual flow - explains where we are taking context from, and where we are taking it to

Contextual Coverage - Explains which part of the article is the heaviest, or what attributes is the article mainly about.

- Every column within the article brief must be in harmony with one another.
    
- Placing our first heading we will need to be able to sense the last heading, and from the last heading we will need to be able to sense the first and last anchor texts.
    
- We will also need to be able to sense the entire structure and hierarchy, also according to the instructions, we might need to change or adjust the hierarchy or the anchor texts.
    
- Our queries we are targeting for that query network are about a variety of attributes, there should be a justification for giving contextual coverage to these particular attributes.
    
- If we aren’t linking from these main areas, meaning they aren’t passing relevance or prominence signals, because the article isn’t about that attribute.
    
- If we take the most important sentences from the sub section, side by side, it makes perfect sense. It means the article is written properly, and if not there might need to be some broken points.
    

##   
LLM and AGI’s

- AGI based information retrieval - meaning that the AI on our website will need retrieve all the documents relevant to the question/query, and take the most relevant answers and parts from the documents
    
- There’s an issue if there are conflicting answers, if all the answers are good this is also a problem. If contextual flow and coverage is covered properly, and point the contextual connections with proper distance, and prominence, and how all the parts of the websites are relevant, and the other documents that are most related to these sections.
    

##   
Future Prediction

1. Websites will be talking
    
2. Get the knowledge base
    
3. Verbalise the Knowledge base
    
4. Improve the knowledge base
    
5. Create semantic content networks and topical maps 
    
6. Arrange the contextual weights, coverages and flows 
    
7. Then distribute them
    

  
  

# Lecture 23 - Contextual Connections and Bridges

## Contextual Connections 

- They provide a bridge and reasoning between two different articles, if the internal links don’t have relevance,logic or clickability based on the users, it means pagerank and relevance won’t be passed.
    
- If we change our internal links, but the search engine crawlers don’t change their crawling behaviours to consider them, it means they don’t pay much attention to our internal links or they think we are doing it just for the sake of linking.
    
- Koray always includes distance within the main content between the internal links
    
- He also typically doesn’t link from the top (First few headings), unless other webpages will do the same or there is some lexical relationship between them, it is also an important part in the information tree, and it will be gathering all the pagerank, and according to the way we prioritise the internal links it within the page that all of them link to, we might link back to certain key entities, giving it priority, and the biggest boost in Pagerank.
    
- This way we can configure the semantic content network to distribute the relevance, and focus of the SCN and overall relevance. 
    
- The First 9 or 10 headings must be quality, minimising the need for the bottom part of the article to be of the same quality.
    
- If we don’t have expertise or a budget the top part of the article must be of the most importance
    
- The most important links that are placed towards the top of the article within the main content, must be linked to your source context, considering these are the most important sections - 
    
- In the bottom part - there is minimal distance between internal links, and lower heading levels for less relevance and pagerank
    
- Within a node we have fewer (around 2) contextual connections, and they’re placed towards the bottom of the article. Using minimal links allows for greater relevance and Pagerank to be passed
    
- If we ask a lot of question for a specific attribute, it means that the attribute is important meaning there will need to be more relevance passed to that section
    

## The General Overview

1. We parse the queries finding the most important attributes
    
2. We then ask a general question for it, in our root article, 
    
3. Link to the article
    
4. Then we expand that representative question in the article
    

  

# Lecture 24 - Relevance Configuration and Responsive Construction

Considering Google's search engine is language agnostic (no predominant language), we can use other languages to understand the overall judgements of a search engine for a topic.

  

Sometimes leave URLs for particular headings to allow for the author to understand,study and obtain the knowledge required to answer the question.

  

A change in one contextual connection, can change the entire semantic content network.

  

We can use a coloured heading to signify to look below, where we can include featured snippets (not anymore), or key screenshots or things to consider or analyse for that heading vector.

Steps To Parsing A Featured Snippet

1. Examine the word call out, or as Koray likes to call it consensus call out. As this is the basis of what the most important web sources for this particular question agree upon.
    
2. Parse the question for its characteristics 
    
3. Look at what is bolded (the key points for the answer)
    
4. Understand the semantic role labels, and the logic of the answer
    
5. Analyse the contextual words and the lexical relations
    
6. Look at the most important entities 
    
7. Look at the predicates
    
8. Any authorities or organisations
    

  

# Lecture 25 - Large Language Models and Semantic Algorithms of Google

## How To Answer Definitional Questions or Articles

- Always go with the absolute facts for a question
    
- If that is not possible go for a consensus at least within your document - Don’t have opposing or conflicting declarations within the document or all your web pages.
    
- A single adverb or adjective can eliminate that answer for the search engine
    
- Give definitive and explicit answers by mentioning attributes, and being specific with numbers. Use the long form answer to give more details.
    
- If they publish a research paper, an announcement, and a patent for a particular technology means they’re utilising this technology in a big way
    
- Typically, the questions inside the headings are representative questions, supporting questions and evidence come after representative questions
    

  

# Lecture 26 - Semantic Content Item Brief Template (Sensing Content Network)

## How Topical Map and Content Item Brief Templates Apply To A Whole Entity Type

- A Topical Map, and the related content briefs that are created for a entity are applicable and created for the entity type - Considering an entity type 
    
- There will need to be a reduction in the differences between the different types of entity type
    
- For certain entities within a type of entity, certain attributes may be more important for that entity than another in the same type - based on the attribute filtration
    
- Mostly the order established will need to be the same within the contextual vectors, and nodes for the topical map 
    
- The purpose for minimising the changes is because, we are creating a content item brief template for a particular source, and central search intent of the query networks. 
    

  

## How Contextual Connections Are Altered By Different Attributes

- Typically, the anchor texts between the different entity types will remain the same
    
- According to the rare and unique attributes there might be some changes to the contextual connections. 
    

  

## Understanding and Being Able To Make Mass Changes 

- When it comes to attributes, especially root attributes of an entity and entity type, they will be the same across the whole class or type of entity, and search behaviour will most likely be the same 
    
- If we always ask the same questions in the same order for each entity type and its attribute pair, within the targeted content brief. 
    
- If we see we mostly don't get featured snippets, we mostly aren’t able to pass relevance through the internal link. It means directly, we can change the question/title with another in the article for all the different entity types, or add further questions for that attribute. 
    
- A query that exists for one of the entities that are a part of the same entity type might not exist for another one of the entities, but in the context of synthetic search queries, they are created for all entities of that type.
    
- Google might use synthetic, real or both of these search queries for the entities of the same type. 
    
- If a particular attribute or question hasn’t been asked for your specific entity within the entity type but for others within the type, it will be a phrase taxonomy, or phrase sequence that can be used inside headings (Contextual Vector)  or the (Contextual) structure.
    
- So for entities from the same type, we can remove,change, or add more to take feedback from the search engine, which requires bulk changes, in a quick and understandable way
    
- For all the entities from the same type, during content configuration according to the unique attributes we add more things, especially for e commerce 
    

1. One brief might work well for a single product but for another it doesn’t work as well, we try to find the (semantic) distances and the differences and continue to configure the briefs further.
    

  

# Lecture 29 - Prioritization of Topics with Attribute Filtering

Koray went from Water > Water Quality > Water Benefits > nodes underneath this

  

If your website is able to outrank the topical authorities within query networks for a long time, you’re informing the search engine that your source is a website or brand that can give more accurate and rich information compared to the top authorities. If you outrank them for key attributes, for a long time, you will have an authority established. You can then go to the other topics easier.

  

One of the first things that should be done within semantics, is to be clustered/classified with the top authorities (not to be associated with low quality sources in your niché). Hence, why Koray went with the harder topics first.

Koray recommends you open less or fewer pages, especially at the beginning of your new website, and SEO project.

  

# Lecture 31 - Creation of Topical Map with Annotational Semantics

Expansion Of Entity-Attribute Pairs To Contextual Vectors/H1 Headings

- Once you have an entity attribute pair, and a target query or query network
    
- You will have to augment it further by choosing a predicate, adjective or other types of context terms or topical entries, in the macro context which will be reflected in the H1
    
- Try to reflect the predicates further and further
    
- The Attributes don’t always have to be explicitly stated, they can be implied. 
    
- These implications create other connections, and allow us to go further in other areas
    
- From the beginning to the end of the topical map we stay within the same context (Water quality and benefits) - Sometimes by changing water type, water drinking time (morning, Afternoon) or water drinking condition (empty stomach) or another attribute (Water Heat) 
    
- When we use the different attributes within the same context, we try to see which query network we can directly target, and we continue with this consolidation. 
    
- Perfect Explanation - For why you can’t copy Svalbardi, and it only results in greater topical authority for them.

Example 

- Entity Attribute Pair - Water (Entity) and Benefit (Attribute) - Expanded to Benefits Of Drinking Water
    

## Different Title Tag Writing Methodologies (Also Touched On In [Earlier Lectures](https:docs.google.com/document/d/12Q3pyo7Q8lavyPrmlTBXCc1KRwOMcqrUneN8FAOdI2s/edit?fbclid=IwAR1vrmkA19RZFcZtpHcCdtASFE9qlyfA2Pl4TQkbO0QYNIz-VEVSTfR_UTo#heading=h.lzn3hm60p0im)) 

1. Implying the attribute within the question, and including the central entity in that question.
    

1. Example - water and overhydration - Expanded to What happens when you drink too much water? - Overhydration is the main consequence or state your body enters when drinking too much water, therefore it is somewhat implied in the question
    
2. Example - Water and optimum amount of water in the body - Expanded to What Percentage Of The Human Body Is Water? 
    

2. Explicitly stating the entity-attribute pair, then expanding on how you’ll cover that entity attribute pair
    

1. Example - Water and (fluid) retention - Water (Fluid) Retention: Causes and Symptoms - The initial pair of water and retention, is then augmented as in to how it will be covered (the context) in terms of causes and symptoms - which i'm guessing will be in the main content of the article
    
2. Example - Water and Sparkling (Water) - Expanded to Sparkling Water: Benefits, Risks, and Facts 
    

3. Using the entity and attribute pair as the heading
    

1. Example - Water and Quality - Expanded to Water Quality 
    
2. Example - Water and contaminants - Expanded to Water Contaminants 
    

4. A kind of Combination of 1 and 2 - With stating the entity attribute pair, and then asking a contextual question 
    

1. Example - Water and Lemon (water) - Expanded into Lemon Water: What Are The Benefits Of Drinking It?
    

  
  

# Lecture 32 - Signalling the Macro-Context with IR Zones

## Image URLs 

- We don't use any stop, functional or contextual words, we only use the most important terms or phrases for the entity attribute pair (which could just be the entity attribute pair) for the image URL. We just change the order of the most important words 
    

- Example - Water-Microplastics from the heading: Microplastics in drinking water
    

- We might just switch the order in the entity attribute pair, from the heading into the image URL like in the above example.
    
- The purpose for restating the most important terms (entity attribute pair) is to ensure we are reflecting the main context - based on the phrases that can be generated from those words or phrases, the closer they’re to one another, the more overlap there is in the generation the more consolidation in the main context and topic.
    

## Image Alt Tags 

- The Alt Tags include stop, functional and contextual words with the entity attribute pair. Koray typically gives the entity attribute pair with most important contextual terms, and functional words in the Alt Tag for it to make sense 
    
- If there are functional, contextual or any types of specific words within the queries that are very important, they should be included in the alt tags. 
    
- Ultimately Alt Tags are basically a rephrasing of the macro context (H1 title) 
    
- When you don’t want to dilute the context, due to an important quality node (most important article), you can restate the heading as an alt tag (exact match). When you add extra phrases or word sequences there will be an expansion in the context, considering there can be more possible phrases generated by google. 
    

## Headline Images 

- The headline images on the article are important and must be indexed - can be checked by SRC Search Operator 
    
- Headline image uniqueness, quality and topicality, will help the article for further ranking 
    

# Lecture 33 - Limits and Optimization of Momentum

## Publication Date/Frequency

- You want to find a somewhat ‘sweet spot’ where you are showing google, this is a human website, and the website is in a different state than previously (to increase crawl rate).
    
- Koray published 20 articles in Svalbard, to show the search engine, there is a big difference in the current state from the previous state. A big difference will differ from website to website, as a website with 5 pages, would have a monumentally big change with 20 articles then a 10,000 page website would. To ensure that google will have to rerank and look at the source again, we want google to see a big change in state.
    
- Koray chose to publish twenty relative to the URL count of the website, which would be a substantial change relative to that website in terms of the ‘state’
    

## Different Publication Frequency ‘Strategies’

- You can publish a lot of articles suddenly (Hundreds of articles), and do so consistently. Considering, Generative AI (Chat GPT), google and bing removed the websites.
    
- Publish a batch together (20 - 60), then go to smaller quantities in a parternless way 
    
- Then you can publish one by one or a smaller quantity way - Two in a day, 5 in a day, 1 a day, a few days in between then 1 then another the next day etc (patternless). 
    

- Go for the most important topics
    
- Go back and fix the internal links (when you publish the articles)
    
- The initial ranking of content is also dependent upon the neighbourhood content (related content of the other articles), the ranking boost that will come in initial ranking will come after a certain point of historical data.
    
- More historical data will accrue with the longer you take to publish your articles (one by one approach), will increase initial ranking, because there is more historical data (Impressions, Clicks, Search behaviours, and query search sessions), since crawl rate is increased it will increase initial ranking.
    

  

# Lecture 34 - Central Entity and Source Context (Quality Nodes)

## Example - Topical Map - Project - Svalbardi

Central Entity - Water

Source Context: Selling Luxury water - Not only luxury water it’s an arctic water brand - Joining luxury and arctic water together you obtain the most important entity attribute pair of water quality - Considering what separates all other types of water from Svalbardi, is the fact it is ‘luxury’, implies that the water is of superior quality and better than majority of ‘regular’ water. Thus, they charge larger amounts of money for the water. Hence, water quality is the most important attribute of water for Svalbardi because it is the most important part of their source context, and justifies the price they sell their water to consumers (which the price also contributes to them being a luxury water as well). 

Central Search Intent - ‘Drinking Water’ - Site wide N Grams, Phrases, Topical and Contextual Entries - Drinking Water (CSN) is reflected in the root of the semantic content network and the root of the root of the semantic content network. 

## Content Brief

Three Query Columns For Quality Nodes - Exceeding The Quality Thresholds

1. First column comes from the queries that the first ranking page on the SERP - First one is an education website - 
    
2. The second column is slightly different from the first; it is the source we are trying to outrank and be clustered within the search engine’s indexes. If we’re able to outrank them we will be classified with them, and will attain a topical authority status.
    
3. The third column is for different phrase taxonomies, variations and combinations are the different phrase sequences of the same context (different [contextual layers](https:docs.google.com/document/d/12Q3pyo7Q8lavyPrmlTBXCc1KRwOMcqrUneN8FAOdI2s/edit?fbclid=IwAR1vrmkA19RZFcZtpHcCdtASFE9qlyfA2Pl4TQkbO0QYNIz-VEVSTfR_UTo#heading=h.k28252fatazf)) 
    

  

## Purpose Of The Three Columns 

1. Most of the priority is for the first column. It’s important for question generation and contextual vector creation 
    
2. The second column is for taking various context terms from that area to outrank that source
    
3. The third column is for different anchor texts, based upon the different attributes inside the queries.
    

  

## Extra Tips 

- In analysing a search query, we must ‘feel the denses’, You must be able to sense the difference in the density or the weight of a particular word or words in a phrase sequence, and figure out whether the weight of these words fit within its own page. 
    
- If additional words within the root query/context don’t have any value,weight or density, it can mean they’re addressed within the root query and context, meaning that other query doesn’t need to be addressed individually within its own context. 
    

  
  

# Lecture 35 - Contextual Vector Construction from Different Web Sources

## Considerations 

- When we are attempting to outrank the source we are targeting it’s important to balance our ‘uniqueness’ to an extent. If we are too unique (different consensus, writing in a different manner), it will be very hard to achieve rankings for that page and query network. 
    
- Search engines don’t have a perception of the fact, they just have the consensus from authority sources. The 2nd column query list (the source we are trying to be clustered with) is for taking initial approval from the Search engine, when we have the state of authority, is when we are able to distort/alter what the search engine perceives as a fact. 
    

## Structure In The Contextual Vector 

- The use of the numeric value in H1 and title tags, increasing ‘rankings’ and ‘CTR’
    

- Example - 20 Health Benefits Of Drinking Water: Physical, Psychological, and Nutritional 
    
- The most important phrase sequence and Central Search Intent (CSI) directly there ‘Benefits Of Drinking Water’ - CSI is Drinking water
    
- The most important attribute of the central entity (Water) is there as well ‘benefits’ 
    
- Then there’s a specification of context with the use of the number 20, and outlining what type of benefits are going to be given. Ie; ‘health’ ‘physical’ ‘psychological’ ‘Nutritional’ 
    

- In alignment with the context of the H1, the corresponding predicates should also mimic the ‘tone’ of the context in the h1
    

- Example - The word benefit or benefits is positive in tonality, and describes the positive aspects of something. Therefore, the corresponding predicates in relation to the tonality of the contextual term (in this case benefits), should also follow suit. 
    
- The use of the predicates like ‘improves’ ‘increases’ ‘Helps’ ‘Treats’ ‘Prevents’ are positive and follow the tone set in the h1. Ensuring, we have a consistent and straight contextual vector flow.
    
- If It was 20 harms of…… You’d use negative tonality in the following heading such as; decreases, reduces, causes, breaks, effects.
    

- Address the most important derived attribute, of the most important entity attribute pair 
    

- The following headings also address the important derived attribute of health from benefits, and the derived benefits from health which are physical, psychological and nutritional. 
    
- The headings use important derived attributes of physical, psychological, and nutritional in the following 20 numbers - Such as; ‘Physical Performance’ ‘Brain Function’ ‘Weight Loss’ ‘Depression etc
    

- Then comes the importance of distributing the different derived attributes/unnamed entities in a logical order, that also justifies ur H1, while staying in the same context identified in the H1 (‘Health Benefits’).
    
- Creating small word sequences, with word proximity then the order, with predicate and noun, justifying the H1. 
    

  

# Lecture 36 - Macro and Micro Contextual Vectors

## Incremental Heading Order List

- Koray utilises mainly a ‘incremental heading order list’  within the main content headings, as the headings incrementally increase in an order 
    
- The last heading is less important than the first heading in an incremental heading order list, considering numbers are being used.  Utilising numbers is also for featured snippets.
    
- When you create a ‘quality passage’ it increases the total quality of your source
    
- A colon in the h1 heading means that the second section is completed and signified by the first section. The second part  is interpreted in the context of the first 
    
- The order of the context terms (Physical,Psychological, Nutritional)  in the H1 after the colon comes from the queries
    
- We also reiterate the macro context formed in the H1, by sticking to the order established in the H1 Heading, 
    

- Placing one of the physical benefits first; ‘physical performance’, ensures we are reiterating the macro context
    
- Then placing a psychological benefit next is also the same: ‘Brain Function’ 
    

- We should also have a bridges between each part of the heading to another
    

- There is a bridge between physical and psychological which is ‘increases energy’
    

- We should augment the phrases and the context in accordance with the queries
    

- In this case physical performance will signal the word ‘body’
    
- ‘Brain function will signal mental health or mental efficiency’ 
    

- Semantically, there is a lexical relationship between the brain and the body, but we take our meanings from the queries, not the real world.
    
- We choose a macro context, and we order the incremental list based on it, and we try to consolidate a contextual domain, by keeping the closely related benefits together. Also, the sequence in which we list the order list (or benefits in this case), must also make sense with one another (Hydration and a Hangover are causes of one another).
    
- In the top/main areas we attempt to unite the context for the most important aspect health being physical, and in the middle or less important parts we 
    
- Even if we have water mainly in our H1, we will need to take the alternatives or similarities of water, or similar or alternatives of the predicate drinking to stay in the context and go deeper
    

## Topical Map Effect 

- If we take the terms from the headings of the different articles in the processed topical map, we will see the most important words are reflected in the headings (Water, Benefits, Drinking), the other terms (Harms,Effects,Pro’s, Cons, causes, symptoms, other types of water (lemon water etc)) are all connected to these terms 
    
- When we create the list of benefits, we must also use them as a criterion for other types of water 
    
- We don’t say contradicting statements, and we don’t forget what has been stated in other articles or topical maps
    

  

# Lecture 37 - Supplementary and Main Content

## Main and Supplementary Content

- The main content is used to continuously process the macro context
    
- The supplementary content is used to process the micro contexts
    
- There is a bridge between the macro and micro contexts, and the main and supplementary content
    

  

## Bridge Between Supplementary and Main Content

- There is a bridge/border or as Koray [states earlier](https:docs.google.com/document/d/12Q3pyo7Q8lavyPrmlTBXCc1KRwOMcqrUneN8FAOdI2s/edit?fbclid=IwAR1vrmkA19RZFcZtpHcCdtASFE9qlyfA2Pl4TQkbO0QYNIz-VEVSTfR_UTo#heading=h.iphoj4t7zev0), a clear distinction where main content ends and supplementary content begins. The bridge is the point between these two points (Main content ends and Supplementary content begins). The bridge is also the border between macro context and main content and micro contexts and supplementary content
    
- In the example the most important question (How much water should you drink a day) for this root is asked as segway/bridge/border onto the supplementary content. In order to unite two different contexts to minimise the amount of pages created (applies to new web sources). 
    
- We directly reflect the specific questions context, in the macro context, then ask the specific question as a border/bridge.
    

- Considering the question is ‘How much water should you drink a day?’ the benefits of drinking the amount of water you should drink a day, should give you the benefits of water, processed in the macro context
    

- We further deepen our questions, in the context of the main question, by using a H3 and asking a more specific question. Then proceed with Boolean questions for important contextual layers for our contextual domain.
    

- What are the benefits of drinking water in the morning?
    
- Should you drink water before sleep?
    
- Should you drink water before dinner?
    
- Should you drink water during dinner?
    

- We also continue to sharpen until we have covered the question in its entirety, and we touch on the relevant micro contexts that will serve as our contextual connections (internal links) for our other parts of our topical map. 
    
- Repeat again of utilising antonym contexts at the bottom of the article in the supplementary content (increases relevance) 
    
- If we use a number in the h1 heading, if we use the antonym of the context in the supplementary content, we should use another number in the anchor text (especially if it appears in the queries) 
    
- The bridge also serves the purpose of being root and roof for the supplemental content. 
    
- Once we ask a question as the bridge we ask a question.
    

##   
General ‘Rules’ 

- Macro context processed in main content
    
- Micro Contexts processed in supplementary content
    
- Between them there is a border 
    
- When we choose a source to decrease it’s overall authority we take the context terms, from it’s queries that it’s ranking for, and place it at the beginning part (macro context) 
    
- We also reflect our main targeted query network in the main content/context, and also inside the bridge
    
- We don’t really link from the macro context (unless we are linking to a very specific page, that we also do in other root articles), The most important, and relevant internal links inside the main content with distance between them. The lower we go in the contextual hierarchy (H3,H4 etc) the more internal links we have in these sections with less distance.
    

# Lecture 38 - Contextual Hierarchy and Connections

Contextual Hierarchy 

- The heading hierarchy is akin to a semantic content network brief template. Considering we typically replicate the hierarchy.
    

- When using an incremental order heading list, we will always have the same hierarchy for other root articles.
    

- Boolean questions are used for the voice search, considering they’re very easy to answer, this allows for us to take greater historical data from voice search and will b e reflected on web search.
    
- If we can rank in voice search, and obtain greater historical data it will serve the whole article better for ranking as a whole. 
    

Contextual Connections

- Koray will provide the anchor text and will say ‘relevant article’, for the author as a test to ensure that the anchor text is relevant and is a signal for what they’re going to click on. If the author doesn’t understand which article to link in this place it’s an indicator for the anchor text to change. 
    
- The purpose of giving distance between internal links, especially in the main content is too increase clickability, and for the search engines to understand the importance/prominence of the link
    
- When we increase clickability and it being ‘early’ within the content, it has more prominence.
    
- We process the queries, through taking the [three columns](https:docs.google.com/document/d/12Q3pyo7Q8lavyPrmlTBXCc1KRwOMcqrUneN8FAOdI2s/edit?fbclid=IwAR1vrmkA19RZFcZtpHcCdtASFE9qlyfA2Pl4TQkbO0QYNIz-VEVSTfR_UTo#heading=h.4yxfbynjcuza) of queries, and generating questions and distributing them. We create a proper macro context, then contextual vector, then a contextual hierarchy, and distributing contextual connections
    
- The article methodology might cause changes in the contextual vector.
    

  

# Lecture 39 - Contextual Structure Analysis and Flow

## Article Methodology - Contextual Structure

- In the contextual structure, we outline the contextual flow, the contextual direction, context terms, proceeding questions, format of the content, tonality of the content, entity connections (in a particular way), sentence structures, and phrase taxonomies or sequences
    
- Definitions are very important, considering changing a single word's definition changes, all the semantic answers, generated questions, and relevance will change, making other sources more and less relevant.
    
- The contextual structure outlines all the micro semantics, and the small but important changes to things like; word proximity, word co-occurrences, word sequences, and semantic role labels.
    

## Relation To AI

- Considering that chatgpt will be unable to understand this prompting, it will distort the word sequences, perplexity and burstiness. It will use certain types of definition for certain types of context transitions it will be easy to understand that is a generative AI
    
- If we are able to insert certain types of word sequences, and contexts. In other words, managing the machine with micro semantics. 
  

## Lecture 0 - All Notes


**

# The Course - Topical Authority Course - The Beginning 

# Intro (Prior To Lecture 1) 

## Principles 

- Personal - Learn, Earn, Rank 
    
- Community - Share, Help, Grow
    

## Brief General Statements - Topical Authority (TA) 

- Black hat method - Koray sent a DDOS attack to his competitors, this only increased their rankings as google viewed this direct traffic, as them having a brand and being highly authoritative, considering they are getting direct traffic, in conjunction with them having a high page rank. Rankmerge = Direct Traffic + Pagerank 
    

  

## Underlying Principles Of TA 

Topical Authority = Historical Data x Topical Coverage 

- Publishing frequency is one, if not the most important element/aspect of TA, as without some level of consistency that increases in frequency, if there is no frequency and subsequent increase you won’t be able to get the search engine, to look at your source, and rerank it, or properly crawl and index your whole website and the topics within it (that you’re hoping to achieve TA for). 
    
- Topical Map + Semantically Organised Content Network With A Knowledge Base = Semantic Content Network (SCN)
    
- Context And Koray’s Framework (Koraynese) 
    
- Everything Is About Context In Semantics 
    
- Koray’s Framework = Contextual Vector + Contextual Hierarchy + Contextual Structure + Contextual Connection + Contextual Coverage and flow
    
- When it comes to an SCN, every heading, first sentence after heading, paragraph, anchor text, anchor text positions, table, table column, list item, sentence before and after list and question and answer format 
    
- Not every article in a semantic content network needs to be good, but there need to be quality nodes (most important articles, keep them linked on your homepage and therefore closer to the crawlers)
    

  

Understand Macro Semantics = Topical Map + Context Distribution 

Understand Macro Semantics = SMC + Context Construction 

  

Basic Formula For TA = X website outranks Y website for z topic for p months - creates a re-ranking for related topics on X website - When is the real question? - Core algorithm updates are the most important times for re-ranking to occur. Even if the website is optimised you can still lose traffic until the Core Algorithm Update. You must wait for a core algorithm update (where you get feedback from the algorithm and can make adjustments).

  

In order to be able to use TA, you always must use the main topic that is connected to the website’s source context. Your main topic is typically explained by where/what webpages you are getting your traffic to. Not all articles/nodes within a topical map will be of the absolute highest quality, some are just there for topical coverage (to have a topic covered). High page rank with no traffic will not allow you to prove your authority over a particular knowledge domain or topic. Quality nodes are the most important articles that should be placed on the homepage, and should be placed closer for the crawlers (requiring the crawlers to crawl less to find these pages/articles/quality nodes as they are more important, and shouldn’t be as deep in your website). 

  

Semantics are language agnostic (the semantics, content brief and topical map are applicable to different languages even if they’re in english) 

  
  
  

Subordinate Text - Refers to the first sentence after the first heading 

Topical authority is based off of the idea of reducing the cost of retrieval for your website

  

## Algorithmic Authorship and Content Engineering 

In Micro Semantics, we are playing with sequences, orders and compositionality of words, in order to increase the relevance of a sentence to the talked about topic. In other words, we are making ‘micro’ adjustments to words in order for them to be easier for NLP/Google to understand  in relation to a topic we are writing about. 

  

Prioritising attributes and contexts is about finding / defining the signalling places for the relevant attributes in sentences.

Use interrogative terms for such signals

Examples of interrogative terms include "what," "who," "when," "where," "why," and "how." These words are used to form questions that require a specific answer or explanation. For example, "What is your name?" or "Where do you live?" - The interrogative term of where requires a destination, or place, that must be mentioned in relation to the entity mentioned in the query, which in this instance is you.

  

Single word queries, like “penguin”, will create a need to understand and satisfy all the possible contexts.

  

Koray’s Rules For Algorithmic Authorship (Total of 200, Typically authors follow 39, and he gives us 14) - I copied some of these of someone who shared their notes underneath the saigon lecture (I’m unable to find him to credit him - If this is you let me know :) )

- Be certain
    
- Cut the fluff - Delete all contextless words
    
- Use numeric values and explain the instances - Content without numbers doesn’t reflect expertise in Koray’s eyes - Instead of saying here are some ways to…., here are 5 ways to….
    
- Qualify Instances - Here are 5 techniques to kick a soccer ball etc - Be specific with what ur numeric value applies to (6 symptoms, 6 techniques etc) 
    
- Understand the context of verbs - Every verb is connected to and signals a different context (heavily related to Verbs of life article) 
    
- Give examples after a plural noun
    

Example - There are over 40 cryptocurrencies listed on Coinbase, such as Ethereum, Bitcoin and Litecoin. (Cryptocurrencies (plural noun) Ethereum, Bitcoin (Examples) 

- Use the same part of speech tag (word role) in the first word of a sentence for lists, e.g:
    

1. Ensure (Verb) + Noun
    
2. Clear (Verb) + Noun
    
3. Spend (Verb) + Noun
    
4. Absorb (Verb) + Noun
    

Tangible Advice - Use the same PoST (Part Of Speech Tag) for all sentences - Do the same with semantic role labels

- Optimise subordinate text (first sentence after headings) e.g:
    

1. Heading: How to do X…
    
2. Wrong Subordinate Text: X is…
    
3. Correct subordinate text: To do X…
    

Tangible Advice - Match the adjectives, predicates, noun order between questions and answers

  

- Put conditional “if” statements in the second part of the sentence
    

1. Wrong: “If A becomes B, do X.”
    
2. Correct: “Do X, if A becomes B.”
    

Tangible Advice - First declaration then the constraint

- Match anchor text with targeted web pages title.
    

1. Eg. targeted web page title: 10 ways to improve sleep efficiency
    
2. Possible anchor text: sleep efficiency
    

- Do not delay the answer 
    

1. Question - What are the benefits of vision boards for entrepreneurs 
    
2. Correct Answer - There are x main benefits of a vision board for an entrepreneur 
    

- If the page is about how to, don't give a definition
    
- Bold the answer not the search term - the bold part signals the answer part of to the search engine
    

not penguin, but flightless sea bird

- Be cheaper (in terms of cost of retrieval, also influenced by topical authority) - Cost of ranking a website can’t be higher than cost of not ranking a website.
    

  

Even if in theory your website is larger than your competitors, and requires more from google to crawl and index, as long as your website is responsive to as many queries as possible lowers retrieval costs for search engines, in net terms. Considering, your website/source is able to in theory satisfy all the queries within your particular domain rather than crawling 15,000 different websites for 15,000 different queries. 

  

Query Responsiveness - it is actually about giving the correct information to the search engine 

  

Information Retrieval - Is what all on site processes attempt to influence/impact 

- Query to document relevance
    
- Document to Query relevance
    
- Document to Document Similarity 
    
- Query To Query Similarity 
    

  
Information Extraction - Trying to understand sentence structures and give the highest possibility responsive answer at the earliest point.

- Query to question, and question and answer
    
- Focus on question and answer generation for IR (Initial ranking? Information Retrieval?)
    

  
Information Responsiveness - Koray’s Book Keywords to questions (k2q) about question generation - is involving the respective entity, attribute, value combinations with macro and micro content distribution across multiple SCN’s to prove overall quality and relevance of information. 

  

## Entity Identity Creation - 

If you can convince Google that ‘x is y but not z’  with semantics, it means that your topical map is a knowledge base. A website will only rank if they’re similar to you. 

  

Making competitors imitate us in order to rank for these entities. 

  

## LLMo optimization for SEO

1. Fine-tune LLM
    
2. Create a topical map
    
3. Create a semantic content network
    
4. Generate content
    
5. Include human effort
    
6. Improve your knowledge base
    
7. Make your website a speaking AI
    

  

- Find a knowledge base and verbalise it - A knowledge base that relates to your knowledge domain. In other words, it includes the facts and triples of the key entities within your industry/niche. Verbalise it with data to text and slowly 
    

- Use natural language inference with chain of reasoning
    

- Minimise the use of the expensive algorithms of google (be cheaper) 
    
- There are blacklisted and whitelisted words in LLM word usage - because different words are connected to each other within a large language model (LLM) 
    
- The watermarking patents apparently claim a 98% AI content detection success rate - due to the patterns in a LLM. 
    

  

The SEOs who understand will win over imitator

Google patent: Cross language information retrieval

Koray used coded topical graphs to demonstrate his thinking, the graphs show connections between topics for all the topics of the ranking pages

https:infranodus.com/

Language interpretation tool: https:pair-code.github.io/lit/

Check word compositionality and embeddings - The difference between the different word/sentence/context/heading vectors is actually the semantic difference between the two concepts, sentences or words, etc 

  

Background: [https:ai.googleblog.com/2020/11/the-language-interpretability-tool-lit.html](https:ai.googleblog.com/2020/11/the-language-interpretability-tool-lit.html)

Small qualitative differences on a sentence (or byte) level get multiplied and make a huge difference in the end

Sequence modelling (word compositionality modelling) is the backbone of semantic SEO and LLMO

E.g. what is the likelihood that predicates such as chase, eat, or fly appear with the word  “Cat”.

One of Koray’s internal training files on ‘Sensing search engines’:

  

Certain things can be connected to each other when looking at a particular topic, but when looking at a different topic, the topics that we’re previously connected don’t always match the topics that we’re matched when looking at the initial topic, even though in some sense they’re connected but only in the context of that topic. 

  

# Lecture 1 - Introduction To Koray’s Framework

## Structure

- About Us Page - used to define source context and central entities - allowing for better connection of entities to our source context/us in a better proximity
    
- Internal Link Design is also used to direct internal linking between the different articles and pages. 
    
- Content briefs that contain topical maps, and the different briefs. Broken down into different continents, then countries under the continents - to understand the different query networks. 
    

1. You’d want to find the most popular entity within the query network - it is typically a country but differs based on niché 
    
2. Dive into lexical relations - If you’re able to rank for European visa, it’ll be easier to rank for german visa considering, germany is a part of europe. 
    
3. Then relating to semantic similarity and distance - what is the closest most relevant entity to germany - most people would use berlin (but it’s a city in germany) but it’s not the same type of entity (City ≠ Country), it’ll need to be another country that is the same entity type. People would geographically associate one, or multiple of the bordering nations would be the closest to Germany in a semantic sense. However, for google what is semantically closest to Germany, will be based upon user behaviour (google tries to imitate the real world as much as possible, so there is obviously some large correlation between the real world geography or as Koray puts it encyclopaedia of a country, and google’s understanding of the semantic distance between these two things.) However, in terms of google/semantics, the closest countries are; bulgaria, Turkey, and lithuania. 
    

  

## Steps or Tips To creating the topical map 

- Find the most popular entity type within the query networks
    
- And make the map based upon the attributes of the entity type - (repeat not a particular entity but the entity type - Country, City etc) 
    
- Take the attributes, and prioritise the topics (I assume based off the attributes (verbs will come in somewhere here :) )
    
- Establish your topical borders according to proximity between them
    

  

## Content Configuration Considerations/General Overview 

Inside the content configuration we are increasing relevance and query responsiveness to a particular topic, by adding some sections, removing others, and changing internal links, you’re configuring the content for higher relevance to the intended topic. 

  

## Metrics Used To Measure This - 

- How it ranks based on; 
    
- New queries
    
- Lost queries
    
- Shaved queries 
    
- According to that, certain sections are prioritised with each other. 
    
- Bulgaria and lithuania are always linked with Germany - based off search behaviour 
    

  

## [Entity and Attribute](https:docs.google.com/document/d/12Q3pyo7Q8lavyPrmlTBXCc1KRwOMcqrUneN8FAOdI2s/edit?fbclid=IwAR1vrmkA19RZFcZtpHcCdtASFE9qlyfA2Pl4TQkbO0QYNIz-VEVSTfR_UTo#heading=h.dgtpa7htrlle) Pairs 

- When creating a webpage for an entity attribute pair, if that web page ranks well, then it will probably happen for another entity from the same type. 
    
- That is why we use other entities from the same types based upon their mutual attributes 
    
- Even if you write for Germany, you will get impressions from bulgaria and lithuania, because of the Erasmus visa, because all the students from those regions search for that visa, and Germany from those different countries, google associates these countries as being related to one another, despite their not being much local proximity.  
    
- Adjust the topical map, and configure it better,
    
- Increase the relevance between these three countries, so that german related articles can rank for german related queries, lithuania articles for lithuania queries, and bulgaria articles for bulgaria queries, for their own country. 
    
- Internal links will be between them so they can support each other. 
    

  

# Lecture 2 - Introduction to Query Semantics

## Query semantics - 

Query Semantics Come from user behaviours and perception - they don’t come from dictionaries - Every word or search term actually takes their meaning and relevance (in a search engine) based upon the search queries of users (user behaviour). Hence, Lithuania and Germany despite not being close to one another, are related, and relevant in the eyes of the search engine when it comes to visa’s because of users' search behaviour. 

## Only 3 Things Can Be Clustered - Also with different variations - 

1. Queries - (Query to document) (query to user etc) (Query to Query (AKA query clustering))
    
2. Documents
    
3. Users  
    

Matching queries to topics & entities, topics and entities to documents, and then documents to users

## Three Key Concepts - Correlative Queries, Sequential Queries, and Query Paths

Worked Example - Let’s call three different queries - Q1, Q2 and Q3 

1. Correlative Queries - correlative Queries Which query has been searched with the other 
    

Example -  In other words the order doesn’t matter (For this concept), it’s a matter of how many times Q1, Q2, and Q3 are searched together within one search session, and the overall numerical correlation, of how many times these Queries are searched together. Allowing google to understand if the queries are related if there is a high correlation among a large group of users search behaviour. 

2. Query Path - refers to the order in which your search queries. Or the sequential journey of a user in terms of their search queries. 
    

Example - If I search Q1 and Q3, My query path is Q1 then Q3

3. Sequential Queries - Looks at different search sessions of the same user, and looks at the different queries across 2 search sessions (Even though it’s probably more then 2, but 2 is to keep it simple), and checks if the queries in these sessions match the same search context, or user state, they ignore other queries and cluster the queries that are from same context together. 
    

## Extra notes -

- How Google clusters users, and their search behaviours, along with the entities in those search behaviours, and context of those queries will determine which queries are related to what, what borders will exist between topics (topical borders). 
    
- Semantic Distance between different topics will change for each and every broad core algorithm update.
    
- In our topical maps we tend to go broader in order to stay safe from Broad Core Algorithms, How google clusters users in conjunction with search behaviours.
    

  
  

# Lecture 3 - Introduction to Real Topical Maps (TM)

## Topical Maps 

Topical Maps are created not just to imitate or mimic other sources, with a topical map you’re altering the search engines perception of a particular topic, and become an actual authority - because if all you do is imitate, and copy, how can you be an authority/leader in your industry/niché.

## There are 5 concepts that make a topical map - 

1. Raw Topical Map
    
2. Processed Topical Map - Macro Context - [Title Tag Writing Methodologies](https:docs.google.com/document/d/12Q3pyo7Q8lavyPrmlTBXCc1KRwOMcqrUneN8FAOdI2s/edit?fbclid=IwAR1vrmkA19RZFcZtpHcCdtASFE9qlyfA2Pl4TQkbO0QYNIz-VEVSTfR_UTo#heading=h.lzn3hm60p0im) 
    
3. URL - Information Tree
    
4. Description - Summarisation, context and topical terms are included here for the topic.
    
5. Image URL 
    
6. Image Alt Text 
    
7. Publication date 
    

Extra’s

8. Checklist - Whether it has been published
    
9. Notes - Extra details or considerations
    

## 3 main principles for TA 

If you can’t go wider, you must go deeper, if you can’t go deeper you must go faster

1. Vastness - Wider - Wide topical map while connecting everything together, 
    
2. Depth - Deeper - Going deeper for a specific attribute and the context (source)
    
3. Momentum - Faster - Publish more on the specific context, for all the entities from same type
    

## The topical map looks at Entity and Attribute Pairs 

We’re choosing only certain types of attributes for processing the entities - Not every article in a semantic content network or topical map needs to be of the utmost quality, but there need to be quality nodes (most important articles, keep them linked on your homepage and therefore closer to the crawlers) there are parts of the TM that aren’t necessarily important. The way you determine the importance of the (and main) attributes is based on your source context.  
  

## Two Parts Of A Topical Map 

1. Outer Section - Consists of the more wider/vast approach, and are the parts of the topical map that are less important. Less in terms of the depth of the particular topic. 
    
2. Core Section - Is for going deeper based on the specific type of attribute, associated with an entity type.  - Source Context + Central Entity = Core Section (Germany Visa in the example)
    
3. Example - The outer section covers topics like; life in germany, Germany Politics, Germany Religion, Germany Crime Rate. We are looking at these topics very briefly, and aren’t going into particular areas of these topics.  The core section is used for going deeper on the particular attribute of Visas, which is also related to the source context of that website (visa consultancy). Therefore, they discuss all the different types of visas, which I believe would be the values. Entity Is Germany - Attribute is Visa’s - Values are the different types of Visas (C Type, D Type Etc). Then their other local aspects covered as well, like the 
    
4. Source Context - How we make money or monetise with our website/business 
    

  

## Fundamental Aspects Of The Topical Map

- A central entity must be chosen for the Topical Map (TM) and Semantic Content Network (SCN) - It appears in all the articles and is the invariable part (meaning it doesn’t change) of the TM and SCN. 
    
- A source context must also be chosen (or understood) - Source context is basically who you are, how you make money and your brand identity. You will need to create a logical contextual bridge between that entity, and your source context.  
    

# Lecture 4 - Topical Map Components (Revisit)

## Central Search Intent - 

- Combine your source context, and central entity, and you can get your central search intent (some general understanding of it) (Source Context x Central Entity = Central Search Intent). Augment it/Deepen/Sharpen the search intent. 
    
- You must understand [Correlative Queries](https:docs.google.com/document/d/12Q3pyo7Q8lavyPrmlTBXCc1KRwOMcqrUneN8FAOdI2s/edit?fbclid=IwAR1vrmkA19RZFcZtpHcCdtASFE9qlyfA2Pl4TQkbO0QYNIz-VEVSTfR_UTo#heading=h.e3m79fputq02), and [Sequential queries](https:docs.google.com/document/d/12Q3pyo7Q8lavyPrmlTBXCc1KRwOMcqrUneN8FAOdI2s/edit?fbclid=IwAR1vrmkA19RZFcZtpHcCdtASFE9qlyfA2Pl4TQkbO0QYNIz-VEVSTfR_UTo#heading=h.e3m79fputq02), to understand that a query about visa is one step in a 100m race (implying there are more steps before completing the race). In more technical terms, a search about visa’s is related to a variety of other queries (corollary queries) (before, and after it) in a particular type of search behaviour.  Obtaining/taking a visa is one part of a larger journey of visiting, or learning about germany. This is also typical with other things like shopping for Suit shoes, which would be accompanied (theoretically) by searches for pants, shirts, ties, socks etc. Ultimately, the central search intent would be more general than the one individual level (of shoes) and is the overall journey of looking for an outfit. 
    
- What is the main intent of a particular set of queries (determined by search behaviour of the particular user group). Not what is the intent of one individual query but the whole journey of them. 
    
- Macro context for the entire topical map can be generated from, central search intent. If you can understand the associated predicates (Verbs) and prepositions (words like; in,around) then you can create the macro context of TM. We can shape the central search intent around the predicates, propositions and central entity. 
    
- Example Used By Koray - Visiting,Knowing,Learning, Travelling, Living, in/to/for/around Germany. 
    
- Shortened to know and Go Germany - Entails all of the predicates with the central entity
    
- Like the central entity, central search intent must be included in every content brief, webpage, website especially in the (Top part) main content.
    
- One of the predicates will always be included the top of the main content with an internal linking
    

1. Title Tag
    
2. Introduction Areas
    
3. Heading’s 
    

- This should be done to ensure we create similar context vectors
    

What is the main intent of a particular set of queries (determined by search behaviour). Not what is the intent of one individual query. 

## How Central Search Intent Impacts The Core and Outer Part Of The TM

- Core Section - Only focuses on the monetization aspect of how a source makes money in relation to its central entity. The core section is the connection of the source context with the main/central entity. 
    
- Outer Section - Is to not discuss the way a source monetises (Visa consultancy) - is unification with one. Unification of the central entity with one of the predicates (in the example it’s with the predicate know) will also be mainly linking to the core section (and outer parts of the outer section), for better and higher historical data, getting more sessions and queries, and proving that we are more relevant to a particular query.
    
- The Central Entity is also an independent part, and doesn’t belong to the core or outer part section.
    

## Why do we cover the outer section?

When you cover the outer section, we are briefly touching on particular attributes of the central entity. If we are able to provide more information for the attributes in the outer section and the possible contexts that can arise.

- Enough level of expertise
    
- Accuracy 
    
- Unique information
    
- Consistent quality increase
    
- Google’s search engine will increase our sources' context (contextual relevance) to the central entity in terms of relevance. Meaning we will be able to rank higher for the visa section as well.
    

  

## Steps To A Semantic Content Network

1. Focus on an entity type 
    
2. Create a topical map 
    
3. Integrate with the other entities 
    
4. Connect and associate everything together
    

  

# Lecture 5 - Central Entity, Central Search Intent, and Site-wide Ngrams

## Reviewing Past Lectures - 

- Central entity - will be appearing in all the articles and site wide 
    
- Central search intent - Will also be appearing along the whole website
    
- Central entity + Central Search Intent = Site Wide N Grams and Phrases - indicating to the search engine the main topic of the website. 
    
- Higher quality nodes should be closer to the homepage and are typically from the core section of the topical map; not all parts of the TM must be quality. 
    
- Outer section is for higher historical data (more user sessions), and topical relevance, it doesn’t come from the source context, but from the central entity, and part of the central search intent (one verb).
    
- Core section is directly for monetisation and from the source context and central search entity unification. 
    

## Considerations For The Connection Of The Outer and Core Sections

- The outer section of the TM is connected to the particular aspects of the core. The outer section is created through the most important attribute. The outer section of the TM is for the attributes of the central entity, but they must be connected (internally linked) to the core section, and to parts of the outer section. 
    
- The most important part of the outer section will be from the most important attribute - Known as the attribute and context hierarchy, the most important attribute at the top to create higher relevance.
    
- According to the most important node in the core section (in this example it’s visa type), will need to adjust the order of the attributes of the outer section to ensure greater relevance for the most important nodes in the core section. Considering, different attributes will be more relevant or important to different parts of the core section. For example, touching on German drinks, and cuisine will be more important for a tourist visa, then German universities or language schools will be for student visas. 
    

  
  

# Lecture 6 - Processed and Raw Topical Maps (Macro - Micro Contexts) 

## Processed Topical Maps (Entity-Attribute Pairs) 

Title tags are the processed and verbalised versions/expressions of (central) entity-attribute pairs (Germany Politics etc). Every single entity attribute pair, and title tag, should only have one macro context, one focus, and one web page for that specific context and entity-attribute pair (don’t dilute). Each of these specific pages with a macro context will also have a micro context section, which will contain slightly different things, and these slightly different things need to be able to connect to our source context, central entity, and central search intent.

## Different Title Tag Writing Methodologies (Expanded In [Other Lectures](https:docs.google.com/document/d/12Q3pyo7Q8lavyPrmlTBXCc1KRwOMcqrUneN8FAOdI2s/edit?fbclid=IwAR1vrmkA19RZFcZtpHcCdtASFE9qlyfA2Pl4TQkbO0QYNIz-VEVSTfR_UTo#heading=h.oim1v534rc2j)) 

1. Using a conjunctive word (and, for, whereas), with two conditional synonyms (religion and belief)
    

- The word ‘and’ indicates you are a using conditional synonym phrase (for example cost and conditions, typically not synonyms but in this context they’re)
    
- Germany crime rate and safe cities - Crime rate is related to the word safe (antonym) - This is also used to be able to connect back to the source context, where the safest cities can be linked back to particular visa types (Ie; Living in germany, studying etc) 
    

2.  Using an entity-attribute pair (which is its own entity) in the heading then using two of the attributes of the attribute in the entity attribute pair. 
    

- For example - Famous German Singers, Their works and achievements
    
- If you use a plural word with a noun like singers - it expresses a set - with many individual instances of the entity. In Other Words, using a plural noun, indicates there are going to be multiple different entities underneath the umbrella of the plural entity (hypernyms) 
    

3. You can use a combination of the two - somewhat - 
    

- For example - Entity Attribute Pair Was - German Literature - Processed heading - German Writers, Their Works and German Literature.
    
- The purpose for this, I believe is because German Literature (which is the entity attribute pair) all have authors/writers. An author will be included in every single piece of literature talked about, so therefore, it’s natural and perhaps even makes more sense to discuss the author (Especially if they have multiple pieces of famous literature, which tends to happen). In this instance literature is a synonym for works. 
    

4. Utilising an entity attribute pair with a hypernym and using the hyponyms after a colon
    

- For example - Entity attribute pair - German + Celebrity - German Celebrities: Famous Authors, Poets, Actors and Musicians 
    
- Celebrity is a hypernym of Author,poets, actors and musicians, as they can be celebrities 
    

  

## What Search Engines Can Do With Your Title Tags? 

- Google can aggregate all your title tags terms together, and understand your topicality through which words appear the most in them. 
    
- Hence, there is a repetition of certain words in the title tags - from the core section of the TM 
    
- Example - Visa, Application, Fee, Documents, Requirements, Entry, Tourist or apply or getting and other contextual terms in this area.
    
- Topical entries typically represent the overall topicality, the contextual terms reflect what way a particular attribute is processed.
    

  

# Lecture 7 - Topic Distillation with Information Architecture

# Rules and Methodologies For Writing URLs 

- Don’t repeat the same words within a URL
    
- No more than 2 words in one bracket.
    
- If the word is used twice, for different URLs, it is for an internal link.
    
- For Example - Germany/Visa/Culture and Germany/Life/Culture - Both are internally linked to one another.
    
- The most important attribute for the outer section (in this case ‘life’) is to the top, and is a priority.
    
- Other attributes like culture, are processed in the context of the main attribute of life and the same with religion.
    
- According to our source context, central search intent, and core section of the TM, We must be able to prioritise what should be coming/connected where exactly.  
    

  

## How URLs Are Understood, and Crawled/Examined By Google

Related to subsite retrieval, If we want to process and retrieve particular information from this url breakdown/part, the information of this subject (Culture,Religion, Life) will come in the context of the particular central entity (Germany in this case). 

  

URLs are the first thing that search engine crawlers look at, and can decide whether they want to crawl them or not. Basically, if they’re logical, reflect the main topic, and connect to each other with our source context, they will provide a better initial ranking (Minor). - I assume the crawlers decide whether they would want to crawl a particular section. 

  

If you’re able to provide a proper contextual crawl path, and if the outer and core section of the topical map is connected properly, the words they see will be united, processed and complete in the context of life and germany, and they will understand the main topic here (Life in germany), if they find Life and Germany to be quality enough they will crawl, the other corresponding extensions of the URL (Germany/Life/Culture - Considering Germany/Life is quality). 

  

As it pertains to the outer section of the topical map, URL structure (X/Y/Z) will be deeper (Germany/Life/Culture/Religion). Relative to the core section, which is much ‘flatter’. (German/Visa - German/Visa/Student). 

  

In the core section everything comes under Visa (source context main topic), while in the outer section most things come under life. Life will be linking to the visa, and all the nodes/articles underneath will also be linking to the visa. You actually create two sub sections which are connected back to the root. 

  

## The 3 levels of a A Semantic Content Network Hierarchy - Root, Seed and Node

Within a SCN, we are utilising both ontology, and taxonomy. Unlike Silo’s or Hub pages, which only utilise one of them. 

1. Root - The root is what everything (seeds and nodes) will link back to, and it is also what is linked to the homepage.
    
2. Seed - is a sub categorisation of the root, and is broken down into two sections (in the example)
    
3. Nodes -  Are a further breakdown of the seed, into individual articles or pages, and each section is connected back one (Nodes To Seed, and, Seed To Node, Root to Seed, and Seed to Root.)
    

  

According to the url structure, and the information tree the relevance of each attribute to their entities will be changing. 

  
For example if religion is taken from under culture (Germany/life/Culture/Religion) and placed underneath politics (Germany/life/politics/Religion), the relevance will change, and will require that religion is processed in the context of politics, might result in a political issue, related to religion being processed rather than something else. Considering, we are reflecting our overall macro context in our title tags, our url structure can change in relation to them. In this case if religion is to change under politics, the title tag would have to change to something like religion effect on politics, or political parties, or religion political parties in Germany, or even religion's effect on the election, From Religion and Belief Structure In Germany.

  
  
  
  
  

# Lecture 8 - Context Signals in Title Tags and Descriptions

## Meta Descriptions

- Meta Descriptions aren’t ranking factors,
    
- They should reflect your overall topicality
    
- Search engines perceive your meta descriptions as summaries of your article/webpage.
    

  

## Koray’s use of Meta Descriptions

- Koray repeats his titles with slightly different versions and expands upon them.
    
- The order of the document is reflected in the order of the meta description.
    
- If I have heading 1,2 and 3, in that order, My meta description will be in order 1,2 and 3. 
    
- The best way to communicate with the search engine with a complex adaptive system - is to create a pattern/template and make the search engine recognise that pattern by doing it consistently.
    
- The same way we use the supplementary content (the end of the article) to link to our core section and source context. The same way it will be listed at the end.
    
- Whatever we process in our title tag, we expand it then place our micro context within it. Then touch on our micro context within the description
    
- The breakdown of German Job Opportunities, into its own URL structure and article, is because there is significant competition in this particular area, and in order for it to be competitive there must be another semantic content network deployed. This because if the node isn’t successful, it won't affect the other two structures of Germany/Life and Germany/Visa
    

  

# Lecture 9 - Macro-Micro Context with Main and Supplementary Content

## Three Types Of Content In A Document

1. Main Content
    
2. Supplementary Content
    
3. Ads
    

## Macro Context - Main Topic

- Most of the document has to be about your macro context
    
- Main Content will come with a macro context from our title tag
    
- After A Certain number of headings you will realise you are beginning to talk about something else (Supplementary content). 
    

  

## Process Of Reaching Your Main Content, and Macro Context - 

Topical Map Node > Title Tag > Description > Contextual Vector in the form of Headings (H1,H2,H3 etc) > Then we draw a line or distinction based on a particular heading that shifts from main to supplementary content > Create our internal links

  

Contextual vectors are displayed and established in the form of headings.

Each node has one macro context and main section, and the micro context inside the supplementary context is always diverse, and changing.

## Connecting Main and Supplementary Content

- In the main content we will discuss our macro context (main topic of the webpage), and in logical semantic manner, the headings will descend into the supplementary context, as each heading has its own micro context, and is gradually changing what you’re talking about. Until we can start linking back to the source context
    
- The Example - The H1 - Safest cities in Germany (macro context) - considering the word is a plural noun, this will be a ranked entity list, create a listicle as headings and give the safest cities with tables, and comparisons of them for each section. When it comes to supplementary content, we can’t talk about the macro context (already been covered), we can talk about something else still within the context of the document and the macro context, but something that is connected to the source context from our topical map. 
    
- In the supplementary context, we might talk about the most crowded, most dense, the highest traffic or crime rate.
    
- Koray typically uses an antonym, (the opposite of a word) of safety, which could be the most dangerous cities in Germany, while staying in the same entity line, and same topic. If you use an antonym, you will be increasing overall relevance.
    
- When creating this type of supplementary content (antonym), it means we will be creating an internal link, to a different node/article, that will have the macro context of the dangerous cities in Germany, while the supplementary content that reflects the micro context of this article will link back to the other article.
    

## Additional Points

- If there is no search demand on a high enough level, or candidate documents with enough level of authority > Don’t create a new webpage for a macro context.
    
- To be able to create a new web page, we need to see if that specific context vector, and domain needs a new index construction
    
- If there is no need for a webpage, it should be included on the same page, and according to the topical map, it will need to go to another page or context.
    

# Lecture 10 - Context Specification with IR Zones

## Image Alt Tags and URLs

- Alt Tags, and URLS are used to reflect overall topicality, and contextuality better, to increase relevance.
    
- Whatever is included in the web page title,url and description, it is expanded and varies further upon in the alt tags and urls.
    
- If there is certain vocab or words not used before will be used in them
    
- The image urls might be slightly bigger than other urls, with phrases or multiple words in them (no more than 3 words typically)
    
- Shorter URLs = Cost Advantage for search engines (because they easier to process)
    
- If there are two duplicate pages, google will take the one with the shorter URL, as the canonical one.
    
- Shorter URLs are easier for search engines to augment, verbalise and understand the main context of the url.
    
- Alt tags should be an expansion or variation of the image URL
    
- They can also be used to reduce word proximity between corresponding words with one another (Like cost and Germany in Koray’s example), if they are too far from one another in the other sections (title tag, description etc) 
    
- When it comes to the core section, Koray tries to use some context enriching terms along with the main terms that signal topicality
    
- Alt tags are typically longer, and in the headline or featured image Koray doesn’t use sentences, typically uses conjunctions with context terms
    
- The objects at the centre of the image should be included in the alt tag, the objects in the outer part are less important
    
- For example 
    

1. Image URL - German Climate 
    
2. Alt Tag - Germany Climate and Vegetation 
    

  

# ​​Lecture 11 - Publication and Refreshment Frequency

## Publication Frequency 

- Momentum Comes From Publication Frequency - 
    
- Publication Date - Reflects when each article will be published
    

## Rules For Publication Frequency

1. Be patternless. The search engine shouldn’t know when we are publishing our articles. One day publish multiple articles, the next only one, then don’t publish, then post one. Sometimes in the morning, late at night, midday. Ensure there is no pattern and no regular frequency
    
2. If you take a timeline, we should be the source that publishes the most across this timeline. 
    
3. Don’t publish during core algorithm updates, or big algorithmic changes. Publish during a ‘flat’ algorithmic season, where google is looking to find new documents and improve their main index quality
    
4. The main purpose is to take search engine attention, and to also reduce the cost of the search engine crawling (overall) 
    

  

## Example - 

- If a search engine spends money to crawl our website in the particular knowledge domain with numerous sources
    
- Being a ‘new source’, to outrank some of the sources, we must have higher relevance, higher responsiveness, better coverage, and better depth (better overall quality) 
    
- To prove the above section, we will need the attention of the search engine crawlers. 
    
- If we are crawled more than our competitors, it means google has invested money and time in us. If they crawl us more, and the information related to the website is fresher, compared to our competitors, they will need to try our website/web pages (To gain historical data) .
    
- Whenever they crawl, they see new content,  the new content is clearer, more accurate and comprehensiveness is higher 
    
- They’ll realise that ranking us is cheaper, relative to our competitors. This touches on the core concept of Topical Authority, The cost of ranking our website must be cheaper then the cost of not ranking our website
    

  

## Considerations

- If they go through our whole website, and they don’t find anything of quality. They won’t come back for 8 months or 2 core algorithm updates (long time)
    
- Higher discipline is required - Everything must be ready for when get the attention from the search engine
    
- Higher Crawl Rate is typically correlated with positive search rankings
    
- The climbs or peaks in our traffic is a result of reranking. Each re-ranking gives us a greater rankability
    
- In each Broad Core Algorithm Update, there is a box with minimum and maximum threshold of traffic, each source is placed into. With each BCAU you can go into a superior or inferior box. Superior boxes have higher traffic thresholds, and inferior boxes have lower traffic thresholds
    
- The way to increase the box you are in is to gather enough historical data, and comprehensively (high level accuracy and clarity) after a BCAU the rankings will soar, and there are new thresholds.
    
- We are being patternless, and creating differences so the crawlers will have to always crawl our website and will always find increased quality. The more quality thresholds we exceed the higher continuous ranking we are able to attain.

#  Lecture 14 - Koray's FrameWork (Context is Everything) - General Overview

## Content Brief ‘Anatomy’ - When it comes to semantics, everything comes back to context

1. Contextual Vector - Headings
    
2. Contextual Hierarchy - Headings Level
    
3. Contextual Structure - Prompts for the authors
    
4. Contextual Connection - Are the internal links and anchor texts 
    

  

## Overview Of Koray’s Process For His Content Brief’s - ll

1. Takes all the search query terms for the central entity 
    
2. From them he generates questions (related to the contextual Vector)
    
3. Then he prioritises/orders them (attribute filtration)
    
4. Hierarchy for the questions/headings (Contextual Hierarchy) 
    
5. Then a structure for each answer (Contextual Structure) - Explaining how the questions should be answered (the format) - Table (Row Count, Column Count, Column name and order, List (sentence before, and after the list), The image design, Alt tag, what kind of statistics and how many statistics - This also applies to E - Commerce as well
    

  

## Expansion Of The Anatomy 

1. Contextual Vector - The first heading is connected to the last heading with a proper order (Prioritisation) 
    
2. Contextual Hierarchy
    
3. Contextual Structure
    
4. Contextual Connection - Are the internal links and anchor texts - In Koray’s Methodology the most important anchor text is in the [root](https:docs.google.com/document/d/12Q3pyo7Q8lavyPrmlTBXCc1KRwOMcqrUneN8FAOdI2s/edit?fbclid=IwAR1vrmkA19RZFcZtpHcCdtASFE9qlyfA2Pl4TQkbO0QYNIz-VEVSTfR_UTo#heading=h.3c0sy8fpo9j). The root article is connected to the most important nodes, and seeds, and they all link back to this root article. According to the connections there are different internal link prioritizations. 
    

- The purpose for Koray linking to the countries in Europe article first, is because all the countries related root articles will link to europe (the ones that are in europe). Then the europe section will link to the rest of the world. 
    
- The bottom part/supplementary content, and less relevant micro contexts, are where Koray places the bulk of his internal links, and he doesn’t use boilerplate internal links. 
    
- There are less links in the main content for two purposes: One is so that more relevance, and page rank is passed through, and so the more important web pages receive these larger boosts
    
- Also According to the different heading (H1,H2,H3) there will be more or less relevance passed through these headings (H1>H2>H3, in terms of page rank and relevance passed through these internal links).  
    

  

## Colour Codes Koray - 

A  - Can also serve as a reminder to remember to insert the link

1. Might signal the article isn’t ready yet but the internal link is placed 
    
2. Skipped For Now 
    

  

# Lecture 15 - Contextual and Knowledge Domains

  

The entire anatomy of a content brief, stems from the query terms. Without understanding how search engines, read,process, understand, associate, and cluster the search terms and queries. 

Related Powerpoint - [https:www.slideshare.net/KorayGbr/semantic-search-engine-semantic-search-and-query-parsing-with-phrases-and-entities](https:www.slideshare.net/KorayGbr/semantic-search-engine-semantic-search-and-query-parsing-with-phrases-and-entities)

  

## Theory Of Connecting Contextual and Knowledge domains (Example) -

If your website is in one knowledge domain (let’s call it knowledge domain 1), and you want to expand it to another domain knowledge domain (knowledge domain 6), you will need to create a vector, that touches through some minor knowledge domains, and perhaps a larger knowledge domain, this is called your ‘semantic path’. The distance between knowledge domain 1 and 6 is the semantic distance, and will shape the topical map. 

  

Different types of knowledge domains are united under different types of contextual domains, because two different things can come closer together (less semantic distance), with certain types of entities, attributes, contexts, and different types of purposes. Once getting the knowledge domains we will need to connect them with the context.

  

## Process Of Generating The Content Brief

1. We must get all the queries related to our central entity
    
2. To be able to get the other parts of the content brief - We must [process/filter](https:docs.google.com/document/d/12Q3pyo7Q8lavyPrmlTBXCc1KRwOMcqrUneN8FAOdI2s/edit?fbclid=IwAR1vrmkA19RZFcZtpHcCdtASFE9qlyfA2Pl4TQkbO0QYNIz-VEVSTfR_UTo#heading=h.drxs676wca7d) the query, but more specifically the attributes. - To increase the important attributes overall relevance, in the contextual vectors to increase/improve overall relevance
    

  

# Lecture 16 - Attribute Filtration and Criterias - Related to EAV

## Three Criteria For Filtration 

1. Attribute Prominence - Comes from the definition of the entity. In other words if you aren’t able to define an entity without that attribute. Makes the attribute incredibly important for the entity, and therefore highly prominent
    

- For Example - The entity type of a country, can’t be defined without a population (people), therefore the population of a country is highly prominent to an entity that’s a country 
    
- Another example is protein powder without the attribute of protein (it’s just powder 😂), making protein, and different types of protein highly prominent. 
    

2. Attribute Popularity - Popularity is a result of search demand/volume. Basically, when it’s popular attribute, it’s connected to the entity with certain types of references (phrases) 
    
3. Attribute Relevance - It’s a matter of how relevant the attribute is to your source context, not your central entity type. 
    

  

## Worked Example 

- The German League isn’t prominent (Germany still exists without it’s soccer/football league), it is popular (High search demand), and isn’t relevant (Doesn’t really connect to the visa source context)
    
- Population Ticks All The boxes, and is processed directly as a node, and is verbalised under the life and the culture and different types of visas. It is the first and primary attribute for creating the root article. 
    

  

# Lecture 17 - Root of Semantic Content Network

## Contextual Vector 

- The root (of the entire semantic network) article is ‘special’, considering it’s connected to every single attribute, and every other attribute related document is related back to this document. 
    
- The first heading is crucial - The example is What to [know before going](https:docs.google.com/document/d/12Q3pyo7Q8lavyPrmlTBXCc1KRwOMcqrUneN8FAOdI2s/edit?fbclid=IwAR1vrmkA19RZFcZtpHcCdtASFE9qlyfA2Pl4TQkbO0QYNIz-VEVSTfR_UTo#heading=h.2fj202azgpvx) to Germany
    
- The central search intent chosen must be expressed in the root document, when the root document has that specific search intent, it will be able to create the rest of the contextual vector in a proper way. 
    
- The more important attributes for a central entity, based upon the filtration of attributes, the higher up it is in the article. The lower it is in the article the less important it is
    
- The first heading, and especially the first heading in the root document, will be able to be connected to the rest of the documents and expressed in the rest of the heading vectors.
    
- Central Search Intent + H1 = Macro Context and Main content part
    
- Allowing for us distribute/hierarchy organise the attributes, and the contextual connections
    
- A contextual hint direction is given in the contextual structure based on the H1, to tell authors how to answer these headings or questions, and connect to the next headings.
    
- The first heading is the most important, especially in a root document. If you create a bad, less relevant or less responsive, distracted root document, any other document that is linked from here will be less relevant
    
- Considering, the central entity is the root of the URL structure/information tree, and is processed with all the attributes inside the root document. If the root of the information tree/root article is determined by google to be insufficient in quality, then they want to crawl further into the information tree of that root (Germany).
    

  

# Lecture 18 - Contextual Vector and Question Generation

## Why We Use Questions In Our Context Vectors - 

- Also known as the question vector, the reason for using questions, as much as possible, is to help the search engine to understand the particular question format (because create questions from the different sections of your content), and possible answer format. 
    
- This means we are using question, and answer pairs. If the question we are using, and is the most likely question the search engine will be generating from our content, and ranking at the top as a candidate question meaning they can learn the topic from us. 
    
- If we always use the questions, it stops the search engines from having to generate the questions on its own. Making the content more clear and easier to process.
    
- Instead of writing, where is Germany, if we write ‘Germany’ ‘Location Of Germany’, ‘coordinates of Germany’, the search engine will need to generate the question by looking at the answer, and creating possible questions (not certain). If we give it directly, it will be easier for responsiveness, and question and answer pairs. 
    
- When generating a question we need to understand which internal link will be used first in the questions.
    
- Example - Since all the articles in Europe will connect back to the article for europe, this is the same with the German root article, that will be the first and most important link, there will need to be a question related to the continent of germany or location to insert the internal link. 
    
- ‘What Continent Germany is in’ is a Synonym phrase for europe, what ever entity used inside the internal link, is mentioned in a synonym phrase in the corresponding heading/question
    
- The purpose for Koray asking where Germany is in a H2, then what continent is Germany in a H3, and giving the answer in the H3, is because in the H2 there are numerous more answers for the H2. The H3 is more specific to the answer given, and has a reduced number of answers, and you are also reducing the prominence of the link, and the relevance, and pagerank, allowing to pass more relevance, and Page rank to other internal links in the main content area.
    
- The question of Germany’s coordinates is given in a h3 underneath the h2 of the german population. Making the coordinates answer given in the context of the population, in other words, to distribute the population of Germany based on the coordinates, to expand the population context a bit further.
    

  

## Contextual Flow -

- Contextual Flow is the order in which contexts are processed. Contextual flow is keeping the contextual vector straight in one piece, that makes logical sense, with the whole thing flowing in a straight line, and every contextual domain that is chosen has a proper flow. Nearly every contextual domain has two headings.
    
- Example -  where is Germany, What continent is Germany in, What is Germany’s population, What Are Germany Coordinates, What Is Germany Time Zone, other questions are also asked.
    
- Then there is a descriptive question (What is the area of Germany) added to complete the other contextual domains. 
    

  

# Lecture 19 - Root, Rare, Unique Attributes for Question Generation

## Different Attributes For Entity Types

1. Root Attributes - are attributes that Appear in all of the instances of that entity class or type. 
    

- Example - City - Population, Area, Mayor (Political Party, Name, Personality etc), Parks, Business Centers, Demographics etc.
    

2. Rare Attributes - They don’t appear in every instance of that entity type, and they are certain types of features that only appear for certain entities. 
    

-  Nuclear Plants, Beaches, Forrests, Rivers, historical sites
    

3. Unique Attributes - Are certain types of features that appear only for that specific entity
    

- The Eiffel tower for paris, The Eureka Skydeck for Melbourne
    

## Order to process them - To create higher relevance process

1. Process the Unique attributes first, - it will be a qualifier or definitive measure, or feature for that entity, it will be like using a synonym for that entity or other name for that entity 
    
2. Root - Use them for providing accuracy and comprehensiveness, 
    
3. Rare - For qualifying and signifying the entity in a more comprehensive manner
    

## 4 Main Types of questions 

1. Boolean Questions - You can typically answer them with a yes or no answer
    

- Does Istanbul have parks?
    

2. Definitional Questions - They typically start with a what, and in this case they try to define a particular area. 
    

- What is the most crowded area of Istanbul?
    

3. Grouping Questions - Usually are multiple instances from the same type of entity,  with a context. 
    

- What are the historical sites of Istanbul?
    

4. Comparative Questions - A comparative or superlative word is used in the question in relation to an entity or entities. 
    

- What are the most crowded areas of Istanbul? 
    

## Their application in the content briefs

- Boolean questions are typically at the bottom or mid parts, and can be used to expand a previous questions context, where necessary
    
- Based on the questions in the Context vector, at the end of every section in the contextual structure we give a signal or signifer for the next header.
    
- The H1 is made up of all the H2’s all together and unified should explain the H1
    
- If there is a H3, underneath a H2, there needs to be a contextual bridge from the H2 to the H3
    
- According to the order of the definitional, or contextual opening, then we define and give the answer, then make an intro for the next heading. 
    
- It allows for the protection of the proximity between different terms as well. 
    

  

# Lecture 20 - Question Generation, Ranking and Canonicalization

## Steps To Help Generate Questions

1. Understand what types of words can appear next to or near the entity 
    

- Types, Style, Problems, Relationships
    

2. Expand upon the different types of potential words that can appear next to the entity
    

- Types - Bad Friendships, Good Friendships, Eternal Friendships, Friendship examples from history, moods of friendship etc
    
- We can be more specific with the context - Friendship types in business places, Friendship in sport 
    

3. We can then generate questions for the entity and related attributes
    
4. We must then understand what question is the highest rank for that particular question 
    

For example - We must understand out of these questions that are asking the same thing which of them has been ranked the highest by google - By checking the SERP - In this case the first Question is the best question 

- What is the definition of friendship
    
- What is Friendship 
    
- What does friendship mean in the dictionary
    
- What is the meaning of friendship - This question can also signal the purpose of friendship
    

5. The best question generated is known as a representative question
    
6. Then go deeper with a specific context question from the representative question
    

Examples - Going deeper for certain contextual vectors - 

- What is the second definition
    
- What is the definition of friendship in childhood? - 
    

7. According to the query network we target, we will need to generate more relevant questions to the query group and expand our answers further and further
    

## Extra Tips

- When we as an SEO, don’t have a significant amount of knowledge about the particular knowledge domain, we must train the search engine for the questions we are generating
    
- A question can be asked in an endless number of ways
    
- The shortest question is typically better, then just fix the grammar as an expert
    

## Example - 

1. What is the definition of friendship
    
2. What is Friendship
    
3. What does friendship mean in the dictionary
    
4. What is the meaning of friendship - This question can also signal the purpose of friendship
    

  

# Lecture 21 - Contextual Structure

## Contextual Structure -

We tell authors what they should be writing and in what format. We are providing a logical flow, with the relevant and key points for sufficiently, and efficiently processing a heading in the contextual vector.

- When we put something in the contextual structure, do they spend money?
    
- Our purpose isn’t to write the best article ever, it is to be better than our competitors
    
- In order to proceed in a cost effective manner.
    
- Besides choosing the attributes processed in the article in a certain order, we must also give the format, phrases, or list, or the sentence before and after the list (And order for the specific list), for each individual heading in the contextual vector
    
- Necessities should also be given - Things like numerical values (celcius, cm, mm), particular entities, certain dates etc
    
- Within particular headings that we don’t want to expand their relevance within the context vector within the content, we can process the heading, and go slightly further by asking a proceeding question to the representative question in the heading. Not by asking it directly but rather answering it in the section.
    
- Inquisitive Semantics - Means to give an answer then, ask another question.
    

  

## The Contextual Structure Example For The H1 - 

The definition of Germany should be made. Its population, Location, names of neighbouring countries, the official name of the country, the capital city, the form of government should be conveyed. 

- The purpose for touching on the population (attribute) first, is because it is the most important attribute for us in this context, and it’ll need to be connected to location because it is related to our anchor texts.
    

  
  

# ​​Lecture 22 - Contextual Coverage and Contextual Flow - Important (Revisit later) 

Contextual flow - explains where we are taking context from, and where we are taking it to

Contextual Coverage - Explains which part of the article is the heaviest, or what attributes is the article mainly about.

- Every column within the article brief must be in harmony with one another.
    
- Placing our first heading we will need to be able to sense the last heading, and from the last heading we will need to be able to sense the first and last anchor texts.
    
- We will also need to be able to sense the entire structure and hierarchy, also according to the instructions, we might need to change or adjust the hierarchy or the anchor texts.
    
- Our queries we are targeting for that query network are about a variety of attributes, there should be a justification for giving contextual coverage to these particular attributes.
    
- If we aren’t linking from these main areas, meaning they aren’t passing relevance or prominence signals, because the article isn’t about that attribute.
    
- If we take the most important sentences from the sub section, side by side, it makes perfect sense. It means the article is written properly, and if not there might need to be some broken points.
    

##   
LLM and AGI’s

- AGI based information retrieval - meaning that the AI on our website will need retrieve all the documents relevant to the question/query, and take the most relevant answers and parts from the documents
    
- There’s an issue if there are conflicting answers, if all the answers are good this is also a problem. If contextual flow and coverage is covered properly, and point the contextual connections with proper distance, and prominence, and how all the parts of the websites are relevant, and the other documents that are most related to these sections.
    

##   
Future Prediction

1. Websites will be talking
    
2. Get the knowledge base
    
3. Verbalise the Knowledge base
    
4. Improve the knowledge base
    
5. Create semantic content networks and topical maps 
    
6. Arrange the contextual weights, coverages and flows 
    
7. Then distribute them
    

  
  

# Lecture 23 - Contextual Connections and Bridges

## Contextual Connections 

- They provide a bridge and reasoning between two different articles, if the internal links don’t have relevance,logic or clickability based on the users, it means pagerank and relevance won’t be passed.
    
- If we change our internal links, but the search engine crawlers don’t change their crawling behaviours to consider them, it means they don’t pay much attention to our internal links or they think we are doing it just for the sake of linking.
    
- Koray always includes distance within the main content between the internal links
    
- He also typically doesn’t link from the top (First few headings), unless other webpages will do the same or there is some lexical relationship between them, it is also an important part in the information tree, and it will be gathering all the pagerank, and according to the way we prioritise the internal links it within the page that all of them link to, we might link back to certain key entities, giving it priority, and the biggest boost in Pagerank.
    
- This way we can configure the semantic content network to distribute the relevance, and focus of the SCN and overall relevance. 
    
- The First 9 or 10 headings must be quality, minimising the need for the bottom part of the article to be of the same quality.
    
- If we don’t have expertise or a budget the top part of the article must be of the most importance
    
- The most important links that are placed towards the top of the article within the main content, must be linked to your source context, considering these are the most important sections - 
    
- In the bottom part - there is minimal distance between internal links, and lower heading levels for less relevance and pagerank
    
- Within a node we have fewer (around 2) contextual connections, and they’re placed towards the bottom of the article. Using minimal links allows for greater relevance and Pagerank to be passed
    
- If we ask a lot of question for a specific attribute, it means that the attribute is important meaning there will need to be more relevance passed to that section
    

## The General Overview

1. We parse the queries finding the most important attributes
    
2. We then ask a general question for it, in our root article, 
    
3. Link to the article
    
4. Then we expand that representative question in the article
    

  

# Lecture 24 - Relevance Configuration and Responsive Construction

Considering Google's search engine is language agnostic (no predominant language), we can use other languages to understand the overall judgements of a search engine for a topic.

  

Sometimes leave URLs for particular headings to allow for the author to understand,study and obtain the knowledge required to answer the question.

  

A change in one contextual connection, can change the entire semantic content network.

  

We can use a coloured heading to signify to look below, where we can include featured snippets (not anymore), or key screenshots or things to consider or analyse for that heading vector.

Steps To Parsing A Featured Snippet

1. Examine the word call out, or as Koray likes to call it consensus call out. As this is the basis of what the most important web sources for this particular question agree upon.
    
2. Parse the question for its characteristics 
    
3. Look at what is bolded (the key points for the answer)
    
4. Understand the semantic role labels, and the logic of the answer
    
5. Analyse the contextual words and the lexical relations
    
6. Look at the most important entities 
    
7. Look at the predicates
    
8. Any authorities or organisations
    

  

# Lecture 25 - Large Language Models and Semantic Algorithms of Google

## How To Answer Definitional Questions or Articles

- Always go with the absolute facts for a question
    
- If that is not possible go for a consensus at least within your document - Don’t have opposing or conflicting declarations within the document or all your web pages.
    
- A single adverb or adjective can eliminate that answer for the search engine
    
- Give definitive and explicit answers by mentioning attributes, and being specific with numbers. Use the long form answer to give more details.
    
- If they publish a research paper, an announcement, and a patent for a particular technology means they’re utilising this technology in a big way
    
- Typically, the questions inside the headings are representative questions, supporting questions and evidence come after representative questions

- A Topical Map, and the related content briefs that are created for a entity are applicable and created for the entity type - Considering an entity type 
    
- There will need to be a reduction in the differences between the different types of entity type
    
- For certain entities within a type of entity, certain attributes may be more important for that entity than another in the same type - based on the attribute filtration
    
- Mostly the order established will need to be the same within the contextual vectors, and nodes for the topical map 
    
- The purpose for minimising the changes is because, we are creating a content item brief template for a particular source, and central search intent of the query networks. 
    

  

## How Contextual Connections Are Altered By Different Attributes

- Typically, the anchor texts between the different entity types will remain the same
    
- According to the rare and unique attributes there might be some changes to the contextual connections. 
    

  

## Understanding and Being Able To Make Mass Changes 

- When it comes to attributes, especially root attributes of an entity and entity type, they will be the same across the whole class or type of entity, and search behaviour will most likely be the same 
    
- If we always ask the same questions in the same order for each entity type and its attribute pair, within the targeted content brief. 
    
- If we see we mostly don't get featured snippets, we mostly aren’t able to pass relevance through the internal link. It means directly, we can change the question/title with another in the article for all the different entity types, or add further questions for that attribute. 
    
- A query that exists for one of the entities that are a part of the same entity type might not exist for another one of the entities, but in the context of synthetic search queries, they are created for all entities of that type.
    
- Google might use synthetic, real or both of these search queries for the entities of the same type. 
    
- If a particular attribute or question hasn’t been asked for your specific entity within the entity type but for others within the type, it will be a phrase taxonomy, or phrase sequence that can be used inside headings (Contextual Vector)  or the (Contextual) structure.
    
- So for entities from the same type, we can remove,change, or add more to take feedback from the search engine, which requires bulk changes, in a quick and understandable way
    
- For all the entities from the same type, during content configuration according to the unique attributes we add more things, especially for e commerce 
    

1. One brief might work well for a single product but for another it doesn’t work as well, we try to find the (semantic) distances and the differences and continue to configure the briefs further.
    

  

# Lecture 29 - Prioritization of Topics with Attribute Filtering

Koray went from Water > Water Quality > Water Benefits > nodes underneath this

  

If your website is able to outrank the topical authorities within query networks for a long time, you’re informing the search engine that your source is a website or brand that can give more accurate and rich information compared to the top authorities. If you outrank them for key attributes, for a long time, you will have an authority established. You can then go to the other topics easier.

  

One of the first things that should be done within semantics, is to be clustered/classified with the top authorities (not to be associated with low quality sources in your niché). Hence, why Koray went with the harder topics first.

  

# Lecture 30 - Information Tree and Sub-site Retrieval

Koray recommends you open less or fewer pages, especially at the beginning of your new website, and SEO project.

  

# Lecture 31 - Creation of Topical Map with Annotational Semantics

Expansion Of Entity-Attribute Pairs To Contextual Vectors/H1 Headings

- Once you have an entity attribute pair, and a target query or query network
    
- You will have to augment it further by choosing a predicate, adjective or other types of context terms or topical entries, in the macro context which will be reflected in the H1
    
- Try to reflect the predicates further and further
    
- The Attributes don’t always have to be explicitly stated, they can be implied. 
    
- These implications create other connections, and allow us to go further in other areas
    
- From the beginning to the end of the topical map we stay within the same context (Water quality and benefits) - Sometimes by changing water type, water drinking time (morning, Afternoon) or water drinking condition (empty stomach) or another attribute (Water Heat) 
    
- When we use the different attributes within the same context, we try to see which query network we can directly target, and we continue with this consolidation. 
    
- Perfect Explanation - For why you can’t copy Svalbardi, and it only results in greater topical authority for them.

Example 

- Entity Attribute Pair - Water (Entity) and Benefit (Attribute) - Expanded to Benefits Of Drinking Water
    

## Different Title Tag Writing Methodologies (Also Touched On In [Earlier Lectures](https:docs.google.com/document/d/12Q3pyo7Q8lavyPrmlTBXCc1KRwOMcqrUneN8FAOdI2s/edit?fbclid=IwAR1vrmkA19RZFcZtpHcCdtASFE9qlyfA2Pl4TQkbO0QYNIz-VEVSTfR_UTo#heading=h.lzn3hm60p0im)) 

1. Implying the attribute within the question, and including the central entity in that question.
    

1. Example - water and overhydration - Expanded to What happens when you drink too much water? - Overhydration is the main consequence or state your body enters when drinking too much water, therefore it is somewhat implied in the question
    
2. Example - Water and optimum amount of water in the body - Expanded to What Percentage Of The Human Body Is Water? 
    

2. Explicitly stating the entity-attribute pair, then expanding on how you’ll cover that entity attribute pair
    

1. Example - Water and (fluid) retention - Water (Fluid) Retention: Causes and Symptoms - The initial pair of water and retention, is then augmented as in to how it will be covered (the context) in terms of causes and symptoms - which i'm guessing will be in the main content of the article
    
2. Example - Water and Sparkling (Water) - Expanded to Sparkling Water: Benefits, Risks, and Facts 
    

3. Using the entity and attribute pair as the heading
    

1. Example - Water and Quality - Expanded to Water Quality 
    
2. Example - Water and contaminants - Expanded to Water Contaminants 
    

4. A kind of Combination of 1 and 2 - With stating the entity attribute pair, and then asking a contextual question 
    

1. Example - Water and Lemon (water) - Expanded into Lemon Water: What Are The Benefits Of Drinking It?
    

  
  

# Lecture 32 - Signalling the Macro-Context with IR Zones

## Image URLs 

- We don't use any stop, functional or contextual words, we only use the most important terms or phrases for the entity attribute pair (which could just be the entity attribute pair) for the image URL. We just change the order of the most important words 
    

- Example - Water-Microplastics from the heading: Microplastics in drinking water
    

- We might just switch the order in the entity attribute pair, from the heading into the image URL like in the above example.
    
- The purpose for restating the most important terms (entity attribute pair) is to ensure we are reflecting the main context - based on the phrases that can be generated from those words or phrases, the closer they’re to one another, the more overlap there is in the generation the more consolidation in the main context and topic.
    

## Image Alt Tags 

- The Alt Tags include stop, functional and contextual words with the entity attribute pair. Koray typically gives the entity attribute pair with most important contextual terms, and functional words in the Alt Tag for it to make sense 
    
- If there are functional, contextual or any types of specific words within the queries that are very important, they should be included in the alt tags. 
    
- Ultimately Alt Tags are basically a rephrasing of the macro context (H1 title) 
    
- When you don’t want to dilute the context, due to an important quality node (most important article), you can restate the heading as an alt tag (exact match). When you add extra phrases or word sequences there will be an expansion in the context, considering there can be more possible phrases generated by google. 
    

## Headline Images 

- The headline images on the article are important and must be indexed - can be checked by SRC Search Operator 
    
- Headline image uniqueness, quality and topicality, will help the article for further ranking 
    

# Lecture 33 - Limits and Optimization of Momentum

## Publication Date/Frequency

- You want to find a somewhat ‘sweet spot’ where you are showing google, this is a human website, and the website is in a different state than previously (to increase crawl rate).
    
- Koray published 20 articles in Svalbard, to show the search engine, there is a big difference in the current state from the previous state. A big difference will differ from website to website, as a website with 5 pages, would have a monumentally big change with 20 articles then a 10,000 page website would. To ensure that google will have to rerank and look at the source again, we want google to see a big change in state.
    
- Koray chose to publish twenty relative to the URL count of the website, which would be a substantial change relative to that website in terms of the ‘state’
    

## Different Publication Frequency ‘Strategies’

- You can publish a lot of articles suddenly (Hundreds of articles), and do so consistently. Considering, Generative AI (Chat GPT), google and bing removed the websites.
    
- Publish a batch together (20 - 60), then go to smaller quantities in a parternless way 
    
- Then you can publish one by one or a smaller quantity way - Two in a day, 5 in a day, 1 a day, a few days in between then 1 then another the next day etc (patternless). 
    

- Go for the most important topics
    
- Go back and fix the internal links (when you publish the articles)
    
- The initial ranking of content is also dependent upon the neighbourhood content (related content of the other articles), the ranking boost that will come in initial ranking will come after a certain point of historical data.
    
- More historical data will accrue with the longer you take to publish your articles (one by one approach), will increase initial ranking, because there is more historical data (Impressions, Clicks, Search behaviours, and query search sessions), since crawl rate is increased it will increase initial ranking.
    

  

# Lecture 34 - Central Entity and Source Context (Quality Nodes)

## Example - Topical Map - Project - Svalbardi

Central Entity - Water

Source Context: Selling Luxury water - Not only luxury water it’s an arctic water brand - Joining luxury and arctic water together you obtain the most important entity attribute pair of water quality - Considering what separates all other types of water from Svalbardi, is the fact it is ‘luxury’, implies that the water is of superior quality and better than majority of ‘regular’ water. Thus, they charge larger amounts of money for the water. Hence, water quality is the most important attribute of water for Svalbardi because it is the most important part of their source context, and justifies the price they sell their water to consumers (which the price also contributes to them being a luxury water as well). 

Central Search Intent - ‘Drinking Water’ - Site wide N Grams, Phrases, Topical and Contextual Entries - Drinking Water (CSN) is reflected in the root of the semantic content network and the root of the root of the semantic content network. 

## Content Brief

Three Query Columns For Quality Nodes - Exceeding The Quality Thresholds

1. First column comes from the queries that the first ranking page on the SERP - First one is an education website - 
    
2. The second column is slightly different from the first; it is the source we are trying to outrank and be clustered within the search engine’s indexes. If we’re able to outrank them we will be classified with them, and will attain a topical authority status.
    
3. The third column is for different phrase taxonomies, variations and combinations are the different phrase sequences of the same context (different [contextual layers](https:docs.google.com/document/d/12Q3pyo7Q8lavyPrmlTBXCc1KRwOMcqrUneN8FAOdI2s/edit?fbclid=IwAR1vrmkA19RZFcZtpHcCdtASFE9qlyfA2Pl4TQkbO0QYNIz-VEVSTfR_UTo#heading=h.k28252fatazf)) 
    

  

## Purpose Of The Three Columns 

1. Most of the priority is for the first column. It’s important for question generation and contextual vector creation 
    
2. The second column is for taking various context terms from that area to outrank that source
    
3. The third column is for different anchor texts, based upon the different attributes inside the queries.
    

  

## Extra Tips 

- In analysing a search query, we must ‘feel the denses’, You must be able to sense the difference in the density or the weight of a particular word or words in a phrase sequence, and figure out whether the weight of these words fit within its own page. 
    
- If additional words within the root query/context don’t have any value,weight or density, it can mean they’re addressed within the root query and context, meaning that other query doesn’t need to be addressed individually within its own context. 
    

  
  

# Lecture 35 - Contextual Vector Construction from Different Web Sources

## Considerations 

- When we are attempting to outrank the source we are targeting it’s important to balance our ‘uniqueness’ to an extent. If we are too unique (different consensus, writing in a different manner), it will be very hard to achieve rankings for that page and query network. 
    
- Search engines don’t have a perception of the fact, they just have the consensus from authority sources. The 2nd column query list (the source we are trying to be clustered with) is for taking initial approval from the Search engine, when we have the state of authority, is when we are able to distort/alter what the search engine perceives as a fact. 
    

## Structure In The Contextual Vector 

- The use of the numeric value in H1 and title tags, increasing ‘rankings’ and ‘CTR’
    

- Example - 20 Health Benefits Of Drinking Water: Physical, Psychological, and Nutritional 
    
- The most important phrase sequence and Central Search Intent (CSI) directly there ‘Benefits Of Drinking Water’ - CSI is Drinking water
    
- The most important attribute of the central entity (Water) is there as well ‘benefits’ 
    
- Then there’s a specification of context with the use of the number 20, and outlining what type of benefits are going to be given. Ie; ‘health’ ‘physical’ ‘psychological’ ‘Nutritional’ 
    

- In alignment with the context of the H1, the corresponding predicates should also mimic the ‘tone’ of the context in the h1
    

- Example - The word benefit or benefits is positive in tonality, and describes the positive aspects of something. Therefore, the corresponding predicates in relation to the tonality of the contextual term (in this case benefits), should also follow suit. 
    
- The use of the predicates like ‘improves’ ‘increases’ ‘Helps’ ‘Treats’ ‘Prevents’ are positive and follow the tone set in the h1. Ensuring, we have a consistent and straight contextual vector flow.
    
- If It was 20 harms of…… You’d use negative tonality in the following heading such as; decreases, reduces, causes, breaks, effects.
    

- Address the most important derived attribute, of the most important entity attribute pair 
    

- The following headings also address the important derived attribute of health from benefits, and the derived benefits from health which are physical, psychological and nutritional. 
    
- The headings use important derived attributes of physical, psychological, and nutritional in the following 20 numbers - Such as; ‘Physical Performance’ ‘Brain Function’ ‘Weight Loss’ ‘Depression etc
    

- Then comes the importance of distributing the different derived attributes/unnamed entities in a logical order, that also justifies ur H1, while staying in the same context identified in the H1 (‘Health Benefits’).
    
- Creating small word sequences, with word proximity then the order, with predicate and noun, justifying the H1. 
    

  

# Lecture 36 - Macro and Micro Contextual Vectors

## Incremental Heading Order List

- Koray utilises mainly a ‘incremental heading order list’  within the main content headings, as the headings incrementally increase in an order 
    
- The last heading is less important than the first heading in an incremental heading order list, considering numbers are being used.  Utilising numbers is also for featured snippets.
    
- When you create a ‘quality passage’ it increases the total quality of your source
    
- A colon in the h1 heading means that the second section is completed and signified by the first section. The second part  is interpreted in the context of the first 
    
- The order of the context terms (Physical,Psychological, Nutritional)  in the H1 after the colon comes from the queries
    
- We also reiterate the macro context formed in the H1, by sticking to the order established in the H1 Heading, 
    

- Placing one of the physical benefits first; ‘physical performance’, ensures we are reiterating the macro context
    
- Then placing a psychological benefit next is also the same: ‘Brain Function’ 
    

- We should also have a bridges between each part of the heading to another
    

- There is a bridge between physical and psychological which is ‘increases energy’
    

- We should augment the phrases and the context in accordance with the queries
    

- In this case physical performance will signal the word ‘body’
    
- ‘Brain function will signal mental health or mental efficiency’ 
    

- Semantically, there is a lexical relationship between the brain and the body, but we take our meanings from the queries, not the real world.
    
- We choose a macro context, and we order the incremental list based on it, and we try to consolidate a contextual domain, by keeping the closely related benefits together. Also, the sequence in which we list the order list (or benefits in this case), must also make sense with one another (Hydration and a Hangover are causes of one another).
    
- In the top/main areas we attempt to unite the context for the most important aspect health being physical, and in the middle or less important parts we 
    
- Even if we have water mainly in our H1, we will need to take the alternatives or similarities of water, or similar or alternatives of the predicate drinking to stay in the context and go deeper
    

## Topical Map Effect 

- If we take the terms from the headings of the different articles in the processed topical map, we will see the most important words are reflected in the headings (Water, Benefits, Drinking), the other terms (Harms,Effects,Pro’s, Cons, causes, symptoms, other types of water (lemon water etc)) are all connected to these terms 
    
- When we create the list of benefits, we must also use them as a criterion for other types of water 
    
- We don’t say contradicting statements, and we don’t forget what has been stated in other articles or topical maps
    

  

# Lecture 37 - Supplementary and Main Content

## Main and Supplementary Content

- The main content is used to continuously process the macro context
    
- The supplementary content is used to process the micro contexts
    
- There is a bridge between the macro and micro contexts, and the main and supplementary content
    

  

## Bridge Between Supplementary and Main Content

- There is a bridge/border or as Koray [states earlier](https:docs.google.com/document/d/12Q3pyo7Q8lavyPrmlTBXCc1KRwOMcqrUneN8FAOdI2s/edit?fbclid=IwAR1vrmkA19RZFcZtpHcCdtASFE9qlyfA2Pl4TQkbO0QYNIz-VEVSTfR_UTo#heading=h.iphoj4t7zev0), a clear distinction where main content ends and supplementary content begins. The bridge is the point between these two points (Main content ends and Supplementary content begins). The bridge is also the border between macro context and main content and micro contexts and supplementary content
    
- In the example the most important question (How much water should you drink a day) for this root is asked as segway/bridge/border onto the supplementary content. In order to unite two different contexts to minimise the amount of pages created (applies to new web sources). 
    
- We directly reflect the specific questions context, in the macro context, then ask the specific question as a border/bridge.
    

- Considering the question is ‘How much water should you drink a day?’ the benefits of drinking the amount of water you should drink a day, should give you the benefits of water, processed in the macro context
    

- We further deepen our questions, in the context of the main question, by using a H3 and asking a more specific question. Then proceed with Boolean questions for important contextual layers for our contextual domain.
    

- What are the benefits of drinking water in the morning?
    
- Should you drink water before sleep?
    
- Should you drink water before dinner?
    
- Should you drink water during dinner?
    

- We also continue to sharpen until we have covered the question in its entirety, and we touch on the relevant micro contexts that will serve as our contextual connections (internal links) for our other parts of our topical map. 
    
- Repeat again of utilising antonym contexts at the bottom of the article in the supplementary content (increases relevance) 
    
- If we use a number in the h1 heading, if we use the antonym of the context in the supplementary content, we should use another number in the anchor text (especially if it appears in the queries) 
    
- The bridge also serves the purpose of being root and roof for the supplemental content. 
    
- Once we ask a question as the bridge we ask a question.
    

##   
General ‘Rules’ 

- Macro context processed in main content
    
- Micro Contexts processed in supplementary content
    
- Between them there is a border 
    
- When we choose a source to decrease it’s overall authority we take the context terms, from it’s queries that it’s ranking for, and place it at the beginning part (macro context) 
    
- We also reflect our main targeted query network in the main content/context, and also inside the bridge
    
- We don’t really link from the macro context (unless we are linking to a very specific page, that we also do in other root articles), The most important, and relevant internal links inside the main content with distance between them. The lower we go in the contextual hierarchy (H3,H4 etc) the more internal links we have in these sections with less distance.
    

# Lecture 38 - Contextual Hierarchy and Connections

Contextual Hierarchy 

- The heading hierarchy is akin to a semantic content network brief template. Considering we typically replicate the hierarchy.
    

- When using an incremental order heading list, we will always have the same hierarchy for other root articles.
    

- Boolean questions are used for the voice search, considering they’re very easy to answer, this allows for us to take greater historical data from voice search and will b e reflected on web search.
    
- If we can rank in voice search, and obtain greater historical data it will serve the whole article better for ranking as a whole. 
    

Contextual Connections

- Koray will provide the anchor text and will say ‘relevant article’, for the author as a test to ensure that the anchor text is relevant and is a signal for what they’re going to click on. If the author doesn’t understand which article to link in this place it’s an indicator for the anchor text to change. 
    
- The purpose of giving distance between internal links, especially in the main content is too increase clickability, and for the search engines to understand the importance/prominence of the link
    
- When we increase clickability and it being ‘early’ within the content, it has more prominence.
    
- We process the queries, through taking the [three columns](https:docs.google.com/document/d/12Q3pyo7Q8lavyPrmlTBXCc1KRwOMcqrUneN8FAOdI2s/edit?fbclid=IwAR1vrmkA19RZFcZtpHcCdtASFE9qlyfA2Pl4TQkbO0QYNIz-VEVSTfR_UTo#heading=h.4yxfbynjcuza) of queries, and generating questions and distributing them. We create a proper macro context, then contextual vector, then a contextual hierarchy, and distributing contextual connections
    
- The article methodology might cause changes in the contextual vector.
    

  

# Lecture 39 - Contextual Structure Analysis and Flow

## Article Methodology - Contextual Structure

- In the contextual structure, we outline the contextual flow, the contextual direction, context terms, proceeding questions, format of the content, tonality of the content, entity connections (in a particular way), sentence structures, and phrase taxonomies or sequences
    
- Definitions are very important, considering changing a single word's definition changes, all the semantic answers, generated questions, and relevance will change, making other sources more and less relevant.
    
- The contextual structure outlines all the micro semantics, and the small but important changes to things like; word proximity, word co-occurrences, word sequences, and semantic role labels.
    

## Relation To AI

- Considering that chatgpt will be unable to understand this prompting, it will distort the word sequences, perplexity and burstiness. It will use certain types of definition for certain types of context transitions it will be easy to understand that is a generative AI
    
- If we are able to insert certain types of word sequences, and contexts. In other words, managing the machine with micro semantics. 
  # Lecture 40 - Contextual Structure with Algorithmic Rules

## General Considerations For The Contextual Structure 

- We must define our most important predicate, and central entity with more details, perspectives, and highest level of scientific knowledge relative to our competitors. If we are able to define our most important section/entities, within the knowledge base of google, better than our competitors we will always have higher relevance.
    
- If google obtains the definition (like drinking water) of your most important entity from your source, they will interpret the query, and augmenting the query based off your import
    
- The same with product search, if you are able to create better attribute definitions for certain products (related to your business), better than your competitors, meaning they’re taking the definition of these attributes from your source. If your competitors don’t use the true definition (comes from your source), that comes from the topical authoritative source 
    
- We need to be summative and less comprehensive in the introduction. 
    
- Our purpose is to give the main context, which comes from the first definition. Then we focus on a certain attribute, then we define the activity or process then give the main benefit and reiterate on it. We minimise the specificity of the answers given.
    

  

## How To Structure The Introduction

1. We are essentially mimicking the macro context in its order in a summative manner - Basically informing the search engine what is coming, and in what order in this article.
    
2. Initially there is a definition for the most important entity
    

- Definition of a type of water - ‘Drinking water’ - not the action
    

3. Then we proceed onto the most important aspect of the entity attribute pair
    

- The main benefit of drinking water - also including any important notes like scientific terms 
    

4. Then we provide supporting evidence in the form of the main physical, and psychological benefits, that are also a consolidation of the macro context in the h1 heading.
    
5. We then mention the final type of health benefit ‘nutritional’ and identify its nutritional value
    
6. Then we see drinking waters function for the body
    
7. Then we provide further consolidation by asking an important and related question: How many percent of the human body is water?
    

  

# Lecture 41 - Extractive and Abstractive Summary

## Extractive and Abstractive Summary 

- Everything in the article methodology for an introduction (first paragraph or paragraphs before the first H2) those things will be talked about, mentioned and processed throughout the article in the corresponding sections (H2’s).
    
- The intro is the general summary section for an article
    

Extractive Summary - is the summary that is created with the extracted declarations from the different subsections of an article.

Abstractive Summary - is modifying existing sentences in the key parts of an article, and using it for summarising the entire article

- To be able to give an abstractive or extractive summary, we need the rest of the article (headings, and key phrases, and talking points)
    
- If our General Summary doesn’t flow and is ‘discordant’ then this will make the rest of the article discordant, and less relevant to one another. 
    

Extractive Summary + Abstractive Summary = General Summary

  

### Process For Applying The Extractive and Abstractive Summary

- We will need to create an abstractive summary, which means we will need to imagine the rest of the article in an abstract way. Then we will need to write the introduction for the article
    
- Then we will need to check the intro and conclusion, after the article has been written.
    
- Then we will need to extract (the most important) key points, and distribute them to the summary
    
- We will need to tell our authors, following the order of the article methodology is crucial. 
    

1. Abstractive Summary - Imagine the article complete and write the intro.
    
2. Macro Context (main content)
    
3. Supplementary Content (micro contexts)
    
4. Extract key points further from the Macro and Micro contexts and move them to the general summary part
    
5. We then check if there is proper contextual flow, and no discordance between the intro and the other parts. 
    
6. If there is discordance we continue to configure these sections, and the intro to ensure everything is a straight line with no interuptions, that reflects we stay on the same topic while processing everything with no gap.
    

  

## Basic Rules

- The use of quotation marks - Indicates to the author they will need to distribute the specific phrase sequences without breaking them, with proper grammar structure, the author will need to give unique information, without gibberish, and repetition.
    

- This will ensure the author will be following the proper contextual vector, context terms and always giving unique information
    
- Phrases are important for a few reasons: Internal linking, Word Proximity, and word co-occurrence 
    
- If the phrase appears within the anchor text or one of contextual vectors (Headings), and they don’t appear in the macro context introduction, then the contextual vector isn’t straight, and flowing correctly.)
    
- The utilisation of these quotation marks is to give the authors context hints in the article methodology to ensure they use these phrases properly.
    

- Sample sentences - we also in quotation marks provide sample sentences for the authors to ensure they are able to understand, to ensure they also use certain types of contextual terms in that section of the article. 
    

  

# Lecture 42 - Contextual Structure for Entities from Same Class

## Article Methodology For The Main Content

- When you have an incremental heading order list, each part of the incremental heading (1,2,3 etc) will be answered by the same ‘criterion’, meaning we will answer the same questions for each heading.
    

- Example - We Define X (X being every heading in the list), then we answer how drinking water provides this benefit.
    

- We must Define everything we are talking about within the context of a particular heading 
    

- Example - ‘Increasing Physical Performance’ - We must include the definition of physical performance, and the definition of ‘increasing physical performance’
    

- Before using an internal link, always create a ‘justification’ for the relevance of the internal link, prior to using it
    

- Koray will use the terms that are being used in the anchor text of an internal link, at least 1-5 times before inserting the internal link, and anchor text.
    

## Order Of The Article Methodology For Answering The Question

1. Context Hints - Define X, How does water provide this benefit?, How Long It Affects It?, What Is The Proof Of It (Criterion), Mention entity names and their connection to each other
    
2. Order Hints - Physical Performance, Important Synonym Predicates (Improves,Increases, Develops, makes better etc), and certain effects 
    
3. Question and Sentence Examples/Structures
    

  

# Lecture 43 - Contextual Border

## More Rules

- ‘Exact Definitive Answer’ - Means the first sentence used to answer the question, will be giving the answer directly, precisely, and with certainty. 
    

-  Meaning we aren’t giving the answer with a ‘modality’ - Like should, may, might or can when giving the answer, we directly give the fact
    

- ‘Expansion Of Evidence’ - We expand the answer further with evidence, as a form of support, using different types of representatives of the main answers.
    

- We are also giving different types of phrase sequences with different context variations
    

- Also provide relevant extras - measurements, and different considerations
    
- List definition - Which means using a sentence to define a list. Use a full sentence when defining a list
    
- ‘Descriptive List Definition’ - Giving a different and variative, definition of the benefits of drinking water, in a way you can connect the section, and the following headings/sections, by giving criterion
    
- Listing - A list is utilised to answer the particular heading/contextual vector.
    

- We outline the total number of list elements (how many answers on the list)
    

# Lecture 44 - Micro Semantics

## Supplementary Content

- Considering, the most important format should be used on the most important webpage, we typically use a paragraph format in the supplementary content. 
    

## The Importance Of Using The Correct Format

- If you have a ‘macro context’ match for a specific query network, use the correct format in that article, not everywhere (so you don’t compete with your own answer), in order to inform google this part is just a supporting page, and evidence for the ‘proper’ answer, in the internal link.
    
- Using the correct format, for the proper answer is crucial as a signal for google, to inform them, that this is the most important answer for that question, in order to avoid competing with ur own answers (keyword or passage cannibalisation)
    
- In addition, we will reduce the comprehensiveness of the answer given for that representative question, or will ask a variant of the question, that requires a less comprehensive answer, in the web page that isn’t supposed to rank for that query network
    

# Lecture 45 - Predicates, Nouns, and Distributing Contextual Relevance

- In order to be more relevant to the main query network, we must process the alternative contexts to the individual query network (Predicate, and qualifier). Using the alternatives as substitute contexts for it 
    
- Content item briefs aren’t static prior to creation of the articles, they are dynamic and change in alignment with the other nodes, seeds, roots (articles) and queries. Especially, as it pertains to anchor text (contextual connections), Contextual Hierarchy and contextual vectors (headings)
    

- Anchor text changes from 9 to 14 signs you’re drinking too much water
    

- We can distribute the ‘left over’ context terms that aren’t mentioned within the supplementary content (bottom part)
    

# Lecture 46 - Conditional Synonym Phrases in Macro Contexts

Contextual Vector - Micro and Macro Context Based On The Queries

- The main H1 heading is a conditional synonym phrase, with the answer and is the search query that appears the most in the queries - What happens when you drink too much water? (Water Intoxication) 
    
- The first Anchor text, and structured piece of content (list, table etc) 
    
- If you want to increase relevance and ranking, the first structured content, should always be within the macro context - Typically on the most important context (Attribute) 
    
- Too Much Water is a synonym of Water intoxication, in the real world, however, it’s crucial to be able to see this within the queries (Koray is unable to do so), if you’re able to look through the queries and find a different word sequence, that is apart of that query network, it means that google has identified this as a synonym for main phrase or keyword for that query network, and is therefore good to use as a synonym. However, if we are unable to see it in the queries, it is a decision that needs to be considered. 
    
- We can attempt to fix Google's perception of a topical, and increasing topical consolidation by creating multiple pages for different query networks where necessary. Even if there is some overlap between the web pages that rank for these queries, there is a need for this distinction.
    

# Lecture 47 - Contextual Consolidation within Vectors

- Koray’s purpose for using H2’s (or in this case) is to have borders, and consolidations for certain sections - The H2’s answer the H1, The H3’s answer the H2’s, and the H4’s answer the H3’s
    
- Based upon the importance of a particular H2, we are able to expand the context and sharpen it further with h3’s, h4’s and other types of questions to ensure we are completely covering that part of the query network, based on the search demand and [filtration of the attributes](https:docs.google.com/document/d/12Q3pyo7Q8lavyPrmlTBXCc1KRwOMcqrUneN8FAOdI2s/edit?fbclid=IwAR1vrmkA19RZFcZtpHcCdtASFE9qlyfA2Pl4TQkbO0QYNIz-VEVSTfR_UTo#heading=h.k7x2k2cuql2p).
    
- The way we rank certain things in an order, that aren’t sequential, is through their popularity (overall) and popularity to the entity
    
- Ensure we give more ‘Symptoms’ or more of the key attribute for that particular sub section
    
- H3’s get there context from the ‘root’ question in the H2
    
- We always want to focus on antonyms (or opposites) within the supplementary content
    
- We always should use a query template and use the most important context for it
    

# Lecture 48 - Knowledge-base Construction within Definitions

## Outline Of Intro

1. We begin with a definition of the macro context and the main entity
    
2. We go to the main sections (or samples of the attributes given)
    
3. We then give the justification (especially for the relevant bridges), for our contextual connections 
    
4. All done in the order of the article
    

## Considerations

- The purpose of the intro is to justify the whole article in terms of order, and internal links, and lay the foundations/preview of what is to come
    
- Especially sub context sections (H2’s) must always be reflected in the intro, in the same order.
    

# Lecture 49 - Balancing Contextual Coverage 

- The purpose of not addressing the most important context of symptoms, straight away, is to increase relevance to the contextual vector (of symptoms) and to rank for the question template, or question query. Hence we expand on the question with the representatives of that question
    
- We do minimise the amount/length of content within the less important parts in the main content
    
- Defining what we are talking about before, we begin talking about it
    
- The H2’s act as ‘sub articles’, and summaries of the h3 in a sense
    

## Another rule

- Preceding question 
    
- Using positive language within the YMYL niche, will help for further rankings
    

  
  

# Lecture 50 - Structuring Context with Macro and Micro Semantics

- We have to ensure that our supplementary section isn't too irrelevant from the main content. Hence, Koray links back to the main content at the end of the article.
    
- The specific context, phrases, and keywords in the macro context (H1), will appear throughout the webpage/article, but the words that appear in particular sections won’t appear in the following sections. But there is always a mention of the macro context, context terms in conjunction with other micro contexts.
    

- For example - The phrase ‘drinking too much water’, and ‘water intoxication’, will be mentioned throughout the whole article, considering they’re the macro context.
    
- Key phrases or context terms that relate to subsections like nausea, or the colour of urine, will be mentioned within it’s section, but will not extend past it’s section. 
    
- The only exception to the rule, might be justifying your internal links (contextual connections). 
    

  

# Lecture 51 - Turning Queries into Headings

## The Query Lists For Content item briefs 

- The query lists are ordered based upon according to the order that the keywords rank for the particular URL’s
    

## What happens if the queries are explicit questions?

- We will need to deepen the question context, and ask different variations of the specific questions
    
- After determining the specific macro context (H1), we then begin to variate the question, based on the most important contexts (think lexical relations).
    
- Koray touches on sub parts of the macro context, then siblings of the macro context, in variating the question in the macro context
    

## Contextual Connection 

- This contextual connection to the root article, isn’t mentioned in the introduction, but it’s mentioned within the supplementary content, and it’s micro context
    
- The purpose of it being given within a boolean question and a H4 is because, it allows for a more specific anchor text, and also signifies less relevance to be passed through the internal link
    

  

# Lecture 52 - Including Answer Terms with Contextual Flow

## Article Methodology - Intro

- Defining the most important entity and word sequence, identified in the macro context, at the onset of the article
    
- Then we answer the most important question, related to our topic/macro context
    
- Overall, we are trying to reflect the macro and micro contexts we are going to discuss, we try to implement them within the order they are addressed, as much as possible.
    

## Featured Snippets - Overall Article

- In the featured snippets, information density is very important - Even if someone asks for the male percentage, we include the female percentage (or the ‘sibling’ context).
    
- Koray utilises very similar questions with only a different gender inserted, in order to be able to ‘grab’ both the female and male snippets.
    
- He further optimises this with his sentence structure, by ensuring the dominant context he is ‘pursuing’ (male or female in this case), is emphasised in the question, and the sentence structure giving more weight to the particular context term, then the less important context term based on the question. 
    
- Koray also talks about his ‘bridge’, where he discusses the water percentage in animal bodies, he compares animal bodies to human bodies, utilising numerical values, and percentages. This is crucial as it relates to click satisfaction scores, and understanding your questions, considering the question explicitly states the need for a percentage, including percentages, numerical values, key words or phrases related to a percentage or the change in it (increase, decrease etc), will increase click satisfaction scores possibilities. 
    

# Lecture 53 - Matching and Signalling Anchor Text Terms

## Contextual Connection Justification 

- Koray uses a different then previously mentioned, he utilises the heading to signal/signify that the result, as a result of the process also in the contextual vector, is related to a larger subset (benefits), therefore justifying it’s placement there. This makes sense as ‘losing weight’ is one benefit of drinking water, hence there is some relevance between the question, answer, and contextual connection. I think this is also the purpose for the h4 heading because it’s relevant but not the most relevant, also indicated by the h4. 
    
- Answer terms - the terms used to answer certain questions 
    
- Koray utilises the answer terms to signify, and therefore justify the context he is referring to within the contextual vector 
    

- Utilising body functions within the h2 above, which is an answer term for the benefits, to justify internal linking.
    

## Hidden Columns

- Unique Information Gain Score
    
- Preceding question
    
- Annotation text
    

  

# Lecture 54 - Using Boolean Questions in Queries

## Contextual Vector - Boolean Question

- If you have a heading with a boolean question, we add certain contextual terms (risks and benefits in this case) to the heading (to expand the context to write an article I assume) of our macro context, for an explicit question query. 
    
- The more we increase the similarity between query vocabulary (And semantic role labels), and document vocabulary, the greater the information retrieval score (no matter the iteration of IR). 
    
- If we have a boolean question in our macro context, we should use the similar variations within our contextual hierarchy (will help for ranking). 
    
- To emphasise a contextual connection (internal link), using a variation of the macro context of that other webpage, to justify linking it within that page.
    
- With a boolean question as our macro context, the length of the article remains shorter, similar to the answer of the boolean question. 
    

# Lecture 55 - Consolidating Contextual Relevance

## Analysis Of Queries For Contextual Vector Creation

- Koray takes a general look at the queries, and sees the consistent contextual terms that are within the queries, then checks (through Ctrl + F) the variations, and context terms of the query network.
    
- This allows Koray to utilise ‘distributional semantics’, where the most important context terms within the queries (also based on the number of times they appear in the query network), must be included in some sense within the contextual vector.
    
- Based on themes of the words, even if a word appears within the terms more than another, we may use a synonym instead, if the theme (more relevant to our knowledge domain) of the synonym is more relevant than the one in the queries. 
    

## Quality Nodes

- The purpose of a quality node is supposed to be a webpage, that we prove our quality and authority relative to our competitors
    
- Quality nodes are extremely long, and detailed
    
- As opposed to a boolean question webpage, it’s only for ranking for that query (hence it’s less detailed and shorter).
    

# Lecture 56 - Using Antonyms for Contextual Bridges

## Justifying Contextual Connections 

- Utilising the phrase in the heading that we are going to use in our anchor text allows for greater justification relevance, and pagerank to be passed through our internal links.
    
- If we are able to use the phrases that will appear in the next heading, in the previous headings paragraphs (or subordinate text), will allow for greater justification of contextual flow, and greater 
    
- Stick with consensus given by the authoritative sources, at least until we are an authority ourselves
    
- A lot of these micro ‘configurations’ (micro semantics), are crucial to the contextual flow, between the macro context, bridge, and micro context, along with the justification of contextual connections to other content pieces within our topical map. 
    

# Lecture 57 - Phrase Sequences and Distributional Semantics

- Koray utilises colons within the headings to ensure majority of the relevance calculation is given towards the first part of the heading (before the colon)
    

- Drinking Hot Water: Health Benefits and Risks
    

- The part after the colon is to signal the flow, and sequence of the article
    
- We check those queries, and use the overall weight, and context of those queries, and a look at the documents to help generate the best contextual vectors
    

# Lecture 58 - Using Multiple Content Format in a Single Web Document

## Contextual Vector Adjustments

- If we ask a question with the term ‘what’, with a plural term inside that question, and the question doesn’t require for us to explain something methodological, or a cause or result, we just go with the ‘nouns’ (the named entities) that are most relevant to our particular section.
    
- Considering, less words within the heading allows for greater ‘weight’ to be distributed in the [embeddings](https:en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding) of the particular words within the relevance calculations. 
    
- To increase the relevance further, we use these terms within our headings earlier
    
- We are always finding efficient contexts to connect, and transition from different micro contexts to one another. For example from Benefits to risks, we use misunderstandings (it’s somewhat neutral between the two).
    
- The more we use a particular ‘phrase/word sequence’ and the topical terms throughout our websites entirety, the more relevance sitewide to the particular topic.
    

# Lecture 60 - Creating Information Extraction Points

## Key Configurations Within The Article

- The Introduction of this quality node is the same for as the one given in the root article, with a following of the order of the article, and a definition of the most important phrase/part of our macro context (H1) (Drinking Hot Water), along with our [extractive and abstractive](https:docs.google.com/document/d/12Q3pyo7Q8lavyPrmlTBXCc1KRwOMcqrUneN8FAOdI2s/edit?fbclid=IwAR1vrmkA19RZFcZtpHcCdtASFE9qlyfA2Pl4TQkbO0QYNIz-VEVSTfR_UTo#heading=h.q2owp58i3zsh) summary
    
- The purpose of placing our answer within the grouper question (as a list), and within our contextual hierarchy as a list, is for increasing the chance of a featured snippet 
    
- Let the h2 be a summary for the h3’s, especially if they’re list
    
- Order for the list (of benefits) is given based upon the [attribute filtration](https:docs.google.com/document/d/12Q3pyo7Q8lavyPrmlTBXCc1KRwOMcqrUneN8FAOdI2s/edit?fbclid=IwAR1vrmkA19RZFcZtpHcCdtASFE9qlyfA2Pl4TQkbO0QYNIz-VEVSTfR_UTo#heading=h.cee3viqjjp71) discussed before hand
    

# Lecture 61 - Sequence Modeling and Canonical Queries

## Unique N Grams - Sequence Modelling

- When inspecting or processing a query network, we will realise some of them are canonical or representative queries.
    
- Google is able to predict or assign a probability of the next or proceeding word in a sentence, or query based upon the words already used, otherwise known as sequence modelling.
    
- Google also use this for ‘query refinements’ 
    
- If we are able to give unique ‘n-grams’ with unique phrases, we are perceived as an authority, as we are able to give unique and new information.
    
- We are able to use different lexical relationships (specifically hyponyms), to provide these unique n grams, particularly if there are some of these context terms that are in the query, we can use them and variate them further based on lexical relations to provide ‘unique n-grams’.
    
- We should do this within the supplementary content, when the queries are really clear in relation to the contexts (contextual signals), that they want discussed for that query network
    
- We must ensure there is a proper contextual flow, by ensuring that our main content (that discusses particular contexts) is logically, and fluently linked to the supplementary content or parts where we can provide unique n grams and unite different ideas, and concepts to prove our topical authority
    

# Lecture 62 - Reading Query Networks

## Analysing Query Networks

- When choosing a webpage, that we are ‘targeting’ for creating our contextual vector, we must ensure that the webpage isn’t ranking just for ‘pagerank’ (or exogenous factors), we must choose a page that is ranking because of its overall and proven topical authority, and unique information.
    
- From a broad perspective, in our contextual vector, we are trying to align the various different word sequences (phrases) that are contextually associated with our base macro context (or the most important phrase in our macro context). This is based on sequence modelling where we are connecting the most probable, next words or previous words that will appear alongside our macro context phrase
    

- For example the context and subsequent phrase of ‘ph of drinking water’ appears to be the most important context (hence it’s the macro context), and is connected to different phrases throughout like ‘high ph drinking water’ ‘low ph drinking water’, but under the guise of particular aspects like harms.
    

# Lecture 63 - Using Multiple Contextual Domains in Main Content

## Arrangement Of The Contextual Vector

- If we have an image ‘annotation’ in the contextual structure, and we use the particular phrase within our paragraphs we will need to generate the actual image
    
- We utilise our supplementary content to build our contextual bridges for the justification of our internal links
    

# Lecture 64 - Connecting Attributes of Central Entity

## Micro Semantic Configurations For Our Article

- Within the intro Koray defines the pH of water, then goes on to define what pH is on its own without the context of water. This showcases the importance of defining our core concepts of our article, and the slight differences of the concept in a different context
    
- If we are able to use the key concepts we are discussing within our images (in a chart or whatever the image is), then it will help for further relevance, and responsiveness, for being served on google
    
- Query Networks (unless they’re an explicitly question network) will typically have a few or multiple representative queries, that are representative of the query network, the contexts, and the main topics, and sub topics that need to be addressed within the article
    

# Lecture 65 - Data to Website

- Justifying the internal link/contextual connection by placing it in an earlier paragraph doesn’t just mean placing the exact phrase that is being used in the anchor text, it means inserting the predicate earlier 
    
- Since it takes time to process certain parts of our topical map, we should include the definition of all the main entities (nouns), sitewide to ensure greater relevance, and connection to the proper parts of the parts of the topical map that we are going to touch on in the future
    

## How to Approach A Content Brief

1. Focus on the context 
    
2. Context Connections 
    
3. Connect everything to query semantics
    
4. Then lexical semantics
    

# Lecture 66 - Auditing Article Relevance and Responsiveness

## Examining Transference Of Content Brief to Article

1. Koray places the article and the brief next to one another on a singular page
    
2. Check The Headings if they match the brief
    
3. The headings hierarchy - h1,h2 etc
    
4. Check each paragraph under each heading, in conjunction with the article methodology
    

## Article Considerations and Author Rules

- Koray doesn’t allow the authors to edit the contextual vector, especially the order of the ‘nouns’ or named entities, or the predicates, but might allow for some changes in the methodology 
    
- Koray recommends to ensure the h2 heading, the font size, and weight, aren’t bigger than the h1, when going deeper in the hierarchy using 4 pixel smaller and lower font weight
    
- Koray typically uses three examples when introducing a key concept, or giving a contextual connection
    
- We are trying to be connected to all different contexts by optimising word proximity and co-occurrences
    

# Lecture 67 - Auditing Order of Declarations and Completeness

## Examining Our Article, and Particular Sentence Structures

- After creating our macro context, we should focus on the order of our introduction (and headings) and our connections between one another
    
- To provide a connection between one sentence to another, we use mutual words, called by Koray as anchor segments. We utilise some of the words, or lexical relations of the words in the next sentence for greater discourse integration
    
- Once we complete the macro context introduction, we utilise the contextual terms, and other word sequences used in the supplementary and micro contexts at the bottom of our introduction.
    
- When we have a representative image (representative of our macro context), we qualify it/introduce it with the sentence before it is placed (similar to a list or table).
    
- The first sentence that comes after the heading is crucial for our webpage to be crawled, as they are able to use predictive information retrieval to determine the cost of crawling our page
    

# Lecture 68 - First Word Sequence

## Utilisation Of Key Knowledge Domain Terms and Contextual Terms

- There are certain words in each article that belong to either the entire article (the macro context), and certain words the belong to particular sections (headings) of the article and don’t really appear across the whole article
    
- These words that appear only in particular sections appear with the words that appear across the whole article to make different co-occurrences between these terms
    
- When it comes to initial ranking, it’s important to give richer and more dense co-occurrence matrices to reflect the context in a better way for greater quantitative score from the search engine
    

  

# Lecture 69 - Auditing Distributional Semantics

- If a key term you are defining has a lot of different contexts, and therefore different definitions within those contexts (physical performance in the bedroom has a different meaning than of that in a weightlifting competition), you could/should specify the context in which you are defining the key concept. This allows for greater relevance to our particular concept, and makes the rest of that section make more sense in relation to this definition.
    
- Koray utilises a lot of the first sentences after the headings with an important contextually related noun, typically reiterating and defining the most important context term in the heading or connecting the macro context directly to it.
    

  

# Lecture 70 - Consensus and Modalities (Formal Semantics)

## Correctly Citing and Obtaining Research and Studies

- When utilising a named entity, that’s a particular form of research, we should include it’s name in quotation marks when we utilise information from this study.
    
- We should integrate all these into our article for the relevant educational literature: 
    

- The research 
    
- Researcher
    
- Research organisation
    
- Date of research 
    
- Topic of research 
    
- Subject count of research
    

- We can use google scholar, or other research organisations for key resources related to our topics
    
- We can also use key researchers and their related works for research to use
    
- We can also use the consensus app to get a key consensus and the most important pieces of research
    

  

# Lecture 71 - Exact Denitive and Declarative Answers

## Key Considerations For Answer Creation

- According to the question and question format we are asking, the answer format should reflect the question being asked.
    
- If you are answering a can or could question with a present tense fact sentence, there is a mismatch between the answer and question format
    
- If we use can,could or might/may, we are talking based on the researches
    
- If we use should we are referring to our personal experience and suggestion
    
- Koray also utilises both the different measurements, when giving specific units (for example Kilos and LB’s) and the conversions of those units to show human effort, expertise, and making us more relevant for different queries and locales
    

  

# Lecture 72 - Using Inquisitive Semantics for Answer Routes

## Answer Optimisation For Generated Questions

- We should always give our declaration (answer) first, then cite our research or researches after the we have given the answer as a form of supporting evidence to what we just said
    
- When we have a hard to use anchor text, we are able to utilise a rhetorical question
    

- ‘However, When asking ‘how much water should you drink a day’
    

- When we have a contextual connection from one article to another, and we ask the specific question of the article in another, we are able to give an overall summative  answer within the article we are linking, including the key points that will be discussed in the individual article
    
- For a question that doesn’t have a concrete answer, we are able to give an initial declaration, and give the conditions in which it makes sense, but also to mention the ‘other side’ of the answer. We should always ‘protect’ the format of the question.
    
- Koray consistently relinks the sections within the supplementary content, back to the key benefits listed in the main section, which allows for greater connection between these two parts, and overall greater content configuration, as it all makes more sense within these contexts
    

  

# Lecture 73 - Bending Meaning and Context (Talking to Search Engine)

## Analysis Of Supplementary Content, and Contextual Content 

- We should consider in our root articles, how we are going to be able to connect our source context to particular aspects, and show the search engine the connection of our topic with our source 
    
- When we don’t have a specific contextual layer in the contextual vector, we can add it to different sections throughout to make this point. 
    

  

# Lecture 74 - Constructing a Knowledge Base (Consistent E-A-V)

## Consistent Answers For Knowledge Base Creation

- Whenever we touch on a key section in one article that has its own article, we want to provide consistent answers throughout that section, and the individual web page for the article. This allows for better quality throughout by google, and greater consolidation of our answer
    
- When creating a list or table, we must utilise the most important contextual terms in conjunction within each section of a list or table (and the main macro context)
    
- If we are able to use multiple unique images in a communicative way to the search engine through reflecting the context or contexts of each section it will also help for further quality
    

  

# Lecture 75 - Represented and Representative Questions and Expansion of Evidence

  
  

# Lecture 76 - Content Configuration with Algorithmic Authorship

- We don’t always have to use a different fact and resource within our multiple articles, as long as the fact is relevant in each case and can be connected to the macro or micro contexts within the article
    
- Even if we include a part of another article, in one of our articles we should always ensure the information is consistent (and sometimes it might be enough to justify internal linking).
    
- Based on Koray’s Saigon speech, we provide greater context/adjectives when we are describing something like symptoms that has a variety of different ‘classifications’ (Mild, Severe, moderate) being more specific than our competitors. 
    
- When you have a plurality it’s easier to utilise these opportunities for creative, and simple images explaining our listing or plurality
    

  
  

# Lecture 77 - Page and Segment-side Context, Answer, Topicality Terms

- When we utilise a list within our headings (for something like symptoms, benefits etc), we should always ensure that we connect it to our macro context
    
- If there is a particular thing that is connected two sibling terms to one another, we should make sure we introduce the sibling term alongside our main one in that particular section with the thing.
    

  

# Lecture 78 - Question and Answer Formats with Neural Matching

- We want to use measurement units and the conversions, if we are able to use more of them than our competitors it’s great for greater relevance
    
- To be able to associate a research within a section, that we are utilising it we can quote a section of the research in the article
    
- If we are unable to deepen a particular context (like animals) use the most representative aspect to for that context (like pets - specifically dogs and cats)
    

  

# Lecture 79 - Contextual Domains and Layers in Answer Construction

- The query vocabulary and a document vocabulary should match, if you have a macro context with the word bad, we will try to mimic the word especially in our earliest sentence to match the ‘query network’ or macro contexts
    

# Lecture 80 - Creating Quality Nodes for Changing Search Engine's Perception 

- Sometimes at the beginning Koray utilises the ‘brand approach’, by giving the brand name (or the pronoun we) we give our expert opinion on the particular manner, to reflect we are the expert source (Topical Authority).
    
- If there’s no consensus on a particular sub topic, or section, we can explain both sides, in terms of there being anecdotal experience, and there being no scientific backing or conflicting studies to ensure we are relevant and more responsive to all queries.

## Lecture 1 - Introduction to Koraynese


# 1 - Introduction to Koraynese
## Koray's Framework
- About Us pages are used for **Source Context**
---
> ***Source Context** is the purpose of the source (website, and web entity (CEO, Social Media Platforms, and collections of other web aspects of brand)), how the brand monetizes its content, and how it turns search engine users into customers and clients.*
---
- Connect every Entity with better relevanve
- Create the following folders:
    - Articles
    - Content Briefs
## Topical Map has 3 main parts
- Contintents are used in the examples due to query networks
- Task: find the most popular entity type in the query network
	- In this case: it by Country
	- Local proximity break down to continents in this case
	- Lexical relations
	- Europan Visa -> German Visa
	- Semantic Distance -> Similarity
	- Germany -> User's Behaviors
		- Bulgaria, turkey, Lithuaina
- Semantic SEO theories come from Dictionaries, not Encyclopedias
- Find the most popular entity type to create the **topical map**, by taking all the attributes, prioritize topics, create topical borders, according to proximity.
---
> <a id="topical-map"></a>***Topical Map** — A topical map is intended to provide a better topical coverage by focusing on all the query networks and query contexts in these search terms, increasing site-wide relevance and responsiveness with higher historical data and quality session logs. A content network design based on semantics for achieving the topical authority state by including overall macro contexts and semantics with publication frequency.*
---
- Europe file contained Countries
- Content Configuration is how you increase relevance
- Internal links, anchor text,
- Entity Attribute Pairs 
- Search Query Sessions
---
>***Semantic Distance** refers to the measure of the conceptual or meaningful difference between two entities or concepts. It quantifies the degree of similarity or dissimilarity between them based on their associations, connections, and path lengths in a semantic network or graph. There are various methods to calculate semantic distance, including measuring association and connection angles, counting connection lengths, and considering the path distance between entities. Semantic distance plays a crucial role in understanding relevance, context, and similarity in natural language processing and search engine optimization (SEO).*

## Structure
- About Us Page - used to define source context and central entities - allowing for better connection of entities to our source context/us in a better proximity  
- Internal Link Design is also used to direct internal linking between the different articles and pages.   
- Content briefs that contain topical maps, and the different briefs. Broken down into different continents, then countries under the continents - to understand the different query networks. 
1. You’d want to find the most popular entity within the query network - it is typically a country but differs based on niché   
2. Dive into lexical relations - If you’re able to rank for European visa, it’ll be easier to rank for german visa considering, germany is a part of europe. 
3. Then relating to semantic similarity and distance - what is the closest most relevant entity to germany - most people would use berlin (but it’s a city in germany) but it’s not the same type of entity (City ≠ Country), it’ll need to be another country that is the same entity type. People would geographically associate one, or multiple of the bordering nations would be the closest to Germany in a semantic sense. However, for google what is semantically closest to Germany, will be based upon user behaviour (google tries to imitate the real world as much as possible, so there is obviously some large correlation between the real world geography or as Koray puts it encyclopaedia of a country, and google’s understanding of the semantic distance between these two things.) However, in terms of google/semantics, the closest countries are; bulgaria, Turkey, and lithuania. 
    

  

## Steps or Tips To creating the topical map
- Find the most popular entity type within the query networks
- And make the map based upon the attributes of the entity type - (repeat not a particular entity but the entity type - Country, City etc) 
- Take the attributes, and prioritise the topics (I assume based off the attributes (verbs will come in somewhere here :) )
- Establish your topical borders according to proximity between them
    

  

## Content Configuration Considerations/General Overview 
Inside the content configuration we are increasing relevance and query responsiveness to a particular topic, by adding some sections, removing others, and changing internal links, you’re configuring the content for higher relevance to the intended topic. 

  

## Metrics Used To Measure This - 
- How it ranks based on; 
- New queries 
- Lost queries
- Shaved queries 
- According to that, certain sections are prioritised with each other. 
- Bulgaria and lithuania are always linked with Germany - based off search behaviour 
    

  

## [Entity and Attribute](https:docs.google.com/document/d/12Q3pyo7Q8lavyPrmlTBXCc1KRwOMcqrUneN8FAOdI2s/edit?fbclid=IwAR1vrmkA19RZFcZtpHcCdtASFE9qlyfA2Pl4TQkbO0QYNIz-VEVSTfR_UTo#heading=h.dgtpa7htrlle) Pairs 

- When creating a webpage for an entity attribute pair, if that web page ranks well, then it will probably happen for another entity from the same type. 
    
- That is why we use other entities from the same types based upon their mutual attributes 
    
- Even if you write for Germany, you will get impressions from bulgaria and lithuania, because of the Erasmus visa, because all the students from those regions search for that visa, and Germany from those different countries, google associates these countries as being related to one another, despite their not being much local proximity.  
    
- Adjust the topical map, and configure it better,
    
- Increase the relevance between these three countries, so that german related articles can rank for german related queries, lithuania articles for lithuania queries, and bulgaria articles for bulgaria queries, for their own country. 
    
- Internal links will be between them so they can support each other.**

## Lecture 2 - Intro to Query Semantics


# User Behavior & Query Semantics
- Query semantics come from user behavior & user perception.
- They don't come from dictionaries
- Search term relevance is determined from the users that search the terms
- Not from how closely-related they are in definition.
- Search Engines can only cluster 3 things
	- Documents
	- Queries
	- Users
- Search Engines' purpose is:
    - Matching Queries to Topics & Entities
    - Topics & Entities to Web Documents
    - Web Documents to Users

### 3 Queries / 3 Users
![](https:hackmd.io/_uploads/S1880MhZp.png)
![](https:hackmd.io/_uploads/SJxZFRf2Wa.png)
![](https:hackmd.io/_uploads/HycRk72-a.png)
- Correlative Queries
    - Which queries have been searched together with another
- Query Path
    - The order of queries in sequence from the user
    - Which queries are leading to which
- Sequential Queries
    - 'Search Sessions' a particular sequence of queries, by the user, associated against chronological internet browsing
    - Sequences of searches are referred to as 'Search State'
    - Corrleations are built based on these behaviors as displayed by the user.
- Query Cluster
- Semantic Distance
    - BCAU (Broad Core Algorithm Updates) change the semantic distance between keywords & topics

## Query semantics - 
Query Semantics Come from user behaviours and perception - they don’t come from dictionaries - Every word or search term actually takes their meaning and relevance (in a search engine) based upon the search queries of users (user behaviour). Hence, Lithuania and Germany despite not being close to one another, are related, and relevant in the eyes of the search engine when it comes to visa’s because of users' search behaviour. 

## Only 3 Things Can Be Clustered - Also with different variations -
1. Queries - (Query to document) (query to user etc) (Query to Query (AKA query clustering))
2. Documents
3. Users  
    

Matching queries to topics & entities, topics and entities to documents, and then documents to users

## Three Key Concepts - Correlative Queries, Sequential Queries, and Query Paths

Worked Example - Let’s call three different queries - Q1, Q2 and Q3 

1. Correlative Queries - correlative Queries Which query has been searched with the other 

Example -  In other words the order doesn’t matter (For this concept), it’s a matter of how many times Q1, Q2, and Q3 are searched together within one search session, and the overall numerical correlation, of how many times these Queries are searched together. Allowing google to understand if the queries are related if there is a high correlation among a large group of users search behaviour. 

2. Query Path - refers to the order in which your search queries. Or the sequential journey of a user in terms of their search queries. 
    

Example - If I search Q1 and Q3, My query path is Q1 then Q3
3. Sequential Queries - Looks at different search sessions of the same user, and looks at the different queries across 2 search sessions (Even though it’s probably more then 2, but 2 is to keep it simple), and checks if the queries in these sessions match the same search context, or user state, they ignore other queries and cluster the queries that are from same context together. 
    

## Extra notes 
- How Google clusters users, and their search behaviours, along with the entities in those search behaviours, and context of those queries will determine which queries are related to what, what borders will exist between topics (topical borders). 
- Semantic Distance between different topics will change for each and every broad core algorithm update.
- In our topical maps we tend to go broader in order to stay safe from Broad Core Algorithms, How google clusters users in conjunction with search behaviours.

## Lecture 3 - Intro to Real Topical Maps


# Lecture 3 - Intro to Real Topical Maps
## 5 Concepts to Real Topical Maps
- [Source context](#source-context)
- [Core section](#core-section)
- [Outer section](#outer-section)
- [Central entity](#central-entity)
- [Central search intent](#central-search-intent)

### 3 Fundamentals 
- Vastness
- Depth
- Fastness
- Entities & Attributes
- Core Section & Oute Attribute
- 'Flat' coverage of Attributes

## Topical Map Example
- To start a Topical Map, you need a Central Entity
- Based on the type of websiit
---
> ***Central Entity** is the entity that appears in every subsection of the semantic content network whether in main content and macro context, or supplementary content and micro context.*

## Lecture 4 - Topical Map Components


# Lecture 4 - Topical Map Components
## Central Search Intent

Source Context is the combination of:
- *Who you are?*
- *How you make money?*
- *Brand identity*

## Augmenting Context to the Macro
- Try to augment the context.
- In the case of the VISA example, it is not just 'getting a visa' that is the context. That is incomplete.
- Instead, it is: ***Visiting, Knowing, Learning, Traveling, Living in/to/for/around Germany.*** which implies 'Visa'
- That is the Macro Context of the entire topical map.
- Shape entire Central Search Intent
    - As in Central Entity, it has to appear in all of the content briefs, all of the web documents, in the main content of the website.
    - Has to create similar context vectors
    - Main Content, Title Text, Headings, Body Text
    - Has to appear with the internal link
- The purpose of the Outer Section of Topical Map — does NOT talk about Visa.
- Core section is focused on the monetization
- Root or Central Entity (Germany) doesn't focus on Visa NOR Monetization
    - Completely independent against the other sections of the Topical Map
- Simplifies Central Search Intent
    - "Know/Go + Germany"
    - "Know/Go" includes all predicates previously included: *Visiting, Knowing, Learning, Traveling, Living*


### The **core section** of the **topical map** is unification of **central entity** with the **source context**.

### The **outer section** of the **topical map** is unification of **specific central entity** and one of the predicates in **central search intent**.
- Outer section of the topical map will mainly be linking the core section
- Better and higher for historical data
- Increasing sessions and queries
- Proving the point that we are more relevant to the specific entity

---
> <a id="source-context"></a>***Source Context** is the purpose of the source (website, and web entity (CEO, Social Media Platforms, and collections of other web aspects of brand)), how the brand monetizes its content, and how it turns search engine users into customers and clients.*
---
><a id="central-search-intent"></a>***Central Search Intent**  is the intent that will appear in all the topical map, and semantic content networks whether it is in boilerplate, or main content.*
---
><a id="specific-entity"></a> ***Specific Entity**  refers to a singular, unique, well-defined, and distinguishable thing or concept. It can be a person, place, item, idea, abstract concept, concrete element, or any combination thereof. An entity is generally represented linguistically by nouns and can be associated with a type or categorization. For example, a specific entity can be a city like "New York City" or a company like "Microsoft Corporation." The term "specific entity" emphasizes the individuality and distinctiveness of the entity.*
---
><a id="topical-relevance"></a> ***Topical Relevance**  refers to the degree to which a piece of content or a website is related to a specific topic or subject matter. It is a measure of how well the content aligns with the user's search query or the overall theme of the website. Topical relevance is important in search engine optimization (SEO) as search engines aim to provide the most relevant and useful results to users based on their search queries. Websites that have high topical relevance are more likely to rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs) for relevant queries.

## Lecture 5 - Central Entity, Central Search Intent, and Site-wide Ngrams


# Lecture 5 - Central Entity, Central Search Intent, and Site-wide Ngrams
1. [Central Entity](#central-entity)
2. [Central Search Intent](#central-search-intent)
3. [Site-Wide Phrases](#site-wide-phrase)
4. [Site-Wide Ngrams](#site-wide-ngram)
5. [Contextual Heirarchy](#contextual-hierarchy)
---
><a id="site-wide-phrase"></a>***Site-Wide Phrase** refers to a phrase that is considered significant or representative for a particular website. It is determined by the phrase-based indexing system developed by Google, which analyzes the phrases that appear on different pages of a website and identifies the top phrases for each page. These top page phrases are then aggregated to determine the top phrases for the entire site. Site-wide phrases are important indicators of the queries for which the website is likely to be relevant.*
---
><a id="site-wide-ngram"></a>***Site-Wide Ngram** refers to the analysis of n-elements from a text, such as phrases or sequences of words, across an entire website. It involves examining the frequency and patterns of these n-elements throughout the site to gain insights into the content and language used. This analysis can help identify repetitive terms, understand the topics covered, and compare the expertise and detail differences between different website segments or competitors. It can also be used to determine the quality and relevance of the content on a website.*
---
**The relationship between the Central Entity, Central Search Intent, Core Section, and Outer Sections is explained within the context of the Source Context.**
* The Central Entity refers to the main concept or topic that is being discussed or searched for.
* The Central Search Intent represents the purpose or goal behind the search query related to the Central Entity.
* The Core Section of a document or webpage contains the main introductory sections that provide the overall direction and context of the content.
* The Outer Sections, on the other hand, refer to the sections of the document that expand on or provide additional information related to the Central Entity. 
* The Source Context determines the macro contexts of the documents and the contextual direction of the content briefs, including the Core and Outer Sections. It helps establish the relevance and perspective between the topic and the source.
*  Sections of the Outer Topical Map may overlap
---
><a id="contextual-hierarchy"></a>***Contextual Hierarchy**, also known as Conceptual Hierarchy, refers to the hierarchical relationship between different contextual web sections or sub-contexts within a given context. It involves the organization of search terms, search intent, or sensitivity-metric into different levels of hierarchy based on their sub-intents and search behaviors. For example, when searching for a flight ticket, there can be multiple sub-intents such as seeking a ticket for holidays or business meetings, or comparing prices between brands or time spaces. The contextual and conceptual hierarchy is created by matching these sub-intents with different search terms or phrases. This hierarchy helps search engines understand the specific context and deliver more relevant search results.[1] Sources: [1] https:www.holisticseo.digital/theoretical-seo/topical-authority

# Lecture 6 - Processed and Raw Topical Maps (Macro - Micro Contexts)
## Title Tags
- Processed version of the Raw Topical Map
- Verbalization of the Entity & Attribute pairs
- You have to have always, one [Macro Context](#macro-context) of your webpage
---
><a id="macro-context"></a>***Macro Context** refers to the main purpose or topic of a specific web page or document. It represents the overall subject matter or entity that the page focuses on. The macro context helps classify and categorize information by determining the main domain or subject matter of the content. It is created by analyzing the use of words and expressions unique to a specific domain or topic. The macro context is important for search engines to understand the relevance and context of a web page or document in relation to a user's query.*
---
- Each page only has one focus. Don't dilute.
- Each page will still contain one [Micro Context](#micro-context)
---
><a id="micro-context"></a>***Micro Context** refers to the specific terms or words closely aligned with the subject matter within a particular domain or body of knowledge. It is determined through the analysis of use and helps in classifying information. A vocabulary list is created with a macro-context (context vector) for each domain, which includes terms that are unique to that domain. Micro context is used to find and classify information based on subsequent inputs of text.*
---
- Micro Context will connect to [Source Context](#source-context), [Central Entity](#central-entity), and [Central Search Intent](#central-search-intent) at the same time.
- LLMs are the top-tool to use because they have a deeper linguistic & semantic understanding
- When it comes to the title tags
- Different methodologies
    - **Using Conjective Verbs 'and'**
        - Conditional synonmym phrase (examples)
            1. Costs and Conditions of Living in Germany
            2. Religion and Belief Structure in Germany
            3. Climate Characteristics and Fauna in Germany
            4. Politics in Germany and German Political Structure
            5. Geographic Structure of Germany and Geography of Germany
            6. Germany Crime Rate and Safe Cities
        - If you need to include certain types of entities in the [Semantic Content Network](#semantic-content-network), use these methods
    - **[Entity Attribute Pairs](#entity-attribute-pairs)**
        - Entity Set
            - Plural word with noun (like Singers) it reflects a set
            - There are many types of individual instances of this group (like works or awards)
    - [**Hypernyms**](#hypernym) -> [**Hyponyms**](#hyponym)

---
><a id="semantic-content-network"></a>***Semantic Content Network** is a structured content network that describes interconnected concepts, their properties, and relationships, with the possibility of optimal contextual vector, hierarchy, and accurate fact extraction. It operates based on the concepts of topical coverage, contextual coverage, and historical data. Topical coverage explains the connection between a knowledge domain and the contextual domain, while contextual coverage includes a context qualifier within a knowledge domain. A knowledge domain includes an entity and an interesting area around it with possible real-world activity. A Semantic Content Network can contribute to a search engine's expansion of its knowledge base by establishing a knowledge-based trust. It can be used to develop various types of NLP algorithms and can have a presence in different topics such as diseases, foods, countries, generals, kings, or companies and CEOs.*
---
><a id="entity-attribute-pairs"></a>***Entity Attribute Pairs** refer to the relationship between entities and their corresponding attributes. An entity is a thing in the real world with an independent existence, while an attribute describes a specific characteristic or property of that entity. Entity Attribute Pairs are used to represent structured information, where each pair consists of an entity and its associated attribute(s). This concept is commonly used in various fields, including knowledge graphs, search engine optimization (SEO), and database systems.*
---
><a id="lexical-relations"></a>***Lexical Relations** refer to the relationships between words based on their meanings. These relations include superiority, inferiority, part, whole, opposition, and sameness between the meanings of words. For example, a word can be a meronymy (part) or hyponym (specific word) of another word, depending on the relationship between their meanings. The value of the lexical relation of one word can affect the structure and context of the next word in a sentence, as well as the Information Retrieval Score, which determines the relevance of content to a query.*
---
><a id="hypernym"></a>***Hypernym** is a word that represents a broader or more general category or concept compared to another word. For example, "color" is a hypernym for the words "red," "blue," and "yellow" because it encompasses all of these colors.*
---
><a id="hyponym"></a>***Hyponym** is a word that indicates a subclass or a more specific category within a broader category. For example, in the category of "animals," "dog" and "cat" are hyponyms. They are more specific types of animals within the broader category of animals. Another example is that "apple" and "orange" are hyponyms of the broader category "fruit."* 
---
><a id="meronymy"></a>***Meronymy** is a linguistic term that refers to the relationship between a word that names a part and a word that names the whole. It is a type of semantic relationship where the part is a component or constituent of the whole. For example, "finger" is a meronym of "hand" because a finger is a part of the hand. Another example is "table leg," where "leg" is a meronym of "table" because it is a part of the whole table.* 


## Lecture 7 - Topic Distillation with Information Architecture


# Lecture 7 - Topic Distillation with Information Architecture
- How we will structure our URL
- No repetition
- Single verse or two verse at most
- Internal links are the bridge between 'topics' in the slugs
- Most important attributes are at the top
- Also contextualized based on subject importance in the greater context
- According to the [**Source Context**](#source-context), [**Central Search Intent**](#central-search-intent), and [**Core Section**](#core-section) of the Topical Map, determines the 'order' of information 
- onwebsites.com/slugs/contextual/relationship
- Proper contextual crawl path creates unity across subject matter
- **Core section** - everything is 'flat' (architecture of content / sitemap)
- [**Outer section**](#outer-section) - most things just 'come under life'
---
><a id="core-section"></a>***Core Section** of a topical map refers to the central or main topic around which the other related topics and subtopics are organized. It is the primary focus of the topical map and represents the main theme or subject of the content network. The core section helps to define the overall structure and hierarchy of the topical map, ensuring that all the topics and subtopics are connected and aligned with the central theme.*
---
><a id="outer-section"></a>***Outer Section** of a topical map refers to the broader topics or categories that are connected to the main theme or focus of the map. It includes the overarching concepts or subjects that are related to the main topic but may not be directly connected to it. For example, in the context of an SEO project, the outer section of a topical map may include related topics such as supplements, vitamins, minerals, exercises, and their connections to e-commerce intents.*
---
- Anythign under life will be linking visa
- Two main subsections that will be connected back to the root.

## 3 Heirarchies of Web Documents
1. Root - Primary layer of a URL structure beyond the domain
3. Seed - Secondary layer
4. Note - Tretiary layer

- Hubs as a ontology
- Silos as a taxonomy
- In Semantic Content Networks, both of these are used at the same time in all 3 instances.
- When slug structures change, title tags need to change with them - as this is providing the Macro Context of the Web Document

## Lecture 8 - Context Signals in Title Tags and Descriptions


# Lecture 8 - Context Signals in Title Tags and Descriptions
- Meta descriptions are not a ranking factor
- They can be used to reflect overall topicality
- Summaries of the articles according to the crawlers
- Synonyms are added to entities; attribute & their variations are added as well
- Context terms & topical entries
- The order of meta descriptions are implications of heading order & web document order
- Create the pattern that search engines will use to determine your content
- Lower the friction search engines require to contextualize your content ([Cost of Retrieval](#cost-of-retrieval))
- Make the search engine recognize the pattern that you're creating.
- [**Macro Context**](#macro-context) (greater overarching subject) is toward the beginning of the Meta Description, with a specific [**Micro Context**](#micro-context) (subsequent inputs) being toward the end of the meta.
- For articles that have a Macro Context of another type, they will be swapped interchangeably.
- If 'Visa' is to be the Macro Context of a Web Document, then it would be mentioned earlier in the Meta Description and Heading Structure.
- "Macro Cotext and specific Micro Context are distributed in the Main Content and Supplementary Content as well."
- Note: if Micro Context of one Web Document is being discussed as a Macro Context of another, they will have an Internal Link connecting the two 

### Meta Description Formula: 
**[Title / Primary Subject & Synonyms]+[Expansion of Topic]+[Micro Context]**

---
><a id="cost-of-retrieval"></a>***Cost of Retrieval** refers to the overall cost incurred during the process of crawling and indexing a document by a search engine. It includes the cost of crawling, rendering, evaluating, associating, indexing, and serving the document to provide value to users. The quality of the document's content and the amount of cost involved in retrieval balance each other. The cost of retrieval can be influenced by factors such as crawl efficiency, indexation signals, and the quality and relevance of the document.*

- *"If there is no search demand, on a enough level, or candidate documents with enough level of authority: do not create a new web page."*

In every Topical Map:
- One Macro Context
- One Main Section
- One Micro Context in the Supplementary Section

## Lecture 10 - Context Specification with IR Zones


# Lecture 10 - Context Specification with IR Zones
- Image Alt Tags
- Image URLs
- Used for relfecting topicality and contextuality of the document
- Any missed verbs or tenses are included in these
- The featured image URLs tend not to extend past 3 words
- Main context of the URL can be implied with these bits of metadata, even in the cases of missing Canonicals
- Alt Image Tags on the [**Core Section**](#core-section) of the Topical Map are usually longer, with additional enriching (because the pages are more important)

### Example:
**Title Tag**: Costs and Conditions of Living in Germany
**URL**: germany/life
**Description**: Expenses and Conditions of Living in Germany...
**Image URL**: germany-life-cycles
**Image Alt Tag**: living conditions and costs in germany
**Publication Date**: 21.05.2021
**Published**: Yes

- The aggregation of nouns, verbs, & their tenses, across all metadata & content, will convey the overall topicality of the website.
- Sentences are not used, context terms or conjunctions are used.

## Lecture 11 - Publication and Refreshment Frequency (Momentum)


# Lecture 11 - Publication and Refreshment Frequency (Momentum)
- Momentum is publication frequency (how often you post)
- 'When' a piece of content is to be published is determined ahead of time
- The search engine should never know when you're going to post
- Posting habits need to be random

## Cost and Search Engines
- [Cost of Retrieval](#cost-of-retrieval) is the amount of money that **search engine crawlers** are spending to crawl your website
- Crawls are an investment in the webiste and the content therein
- If you content is "fresher", they will need to 'test' your content against the targeted audience
- They will come to the conclusion that it cost less to crawl your website to serve good content
- The 'Floors' and 'Ceilngs' of your analytics are the boundaries of volatiility that exist between search engine core algorithm updates

## Publication Dates
- The percieved randomness aids the search crawler in making your website more visited, because there isn't a consistent interval of content being published.

4. **Listing** - List items for FS - Infroductory sentence, list elements, proper HTML List Marking. Heading and Introductory sentence harmony. List must be unordered or ordered form.
5. **Definitive Answer** - Long-form mentioning answer - The long answer, including all concepts (of the entity), should be given with context reinforcement.
6. **"Term"** - Include the Term with Definition or Context - The relevant concept should be passed in the relevant section,

- Sequence modeling can be used to fine-tune the context in words and word sequences.

## Lecture 14 - Koray's Frame Work (Context is Everything)


# Lecture 14 - Koray's Frame Work (Context is Everything)
- Assembly of the following concepts: Contextual **Vector**, [**Hierarchy**](#contextual-hierarchy), **Structure**, & **Connection** into a uniform document (for the content writer)
- Everything that you see on a web document, is contributing the to context
- Contextual Structure is an explanation of the following aspects within Informational content:
    - Lists, Columns
    - Answer types, information needed
    - Format
    - Tables, Rows, Names of all
    - Sentence before the list and after the list
    - Image and alt data
    - Statistics and other data included
- E-commerce would have slightly different context, but just as complete in the reasoning.
- In the Contextual Vector (Heading Structure) the 1st and Last Headings are inter-connected and in a specific order
- Boilerplate Content ([**Outer Section**](#outer-section) [**Topical Map**](#topical-map)) is not as heavily interlinked
- Main Content ([**Core Section**](#core-section) **Topical Map**) are mostly linked in order to create more "crawl weight"
- Page Rank Flow & Relevance Attribution
- Internal Link Weights are intrinstically connected to the context provided by the Heading Hierarchy.
    - This is to say, the most important links should exist within the 'highest-level' heading section.

><a id="contextual-vector"></a>***Contextual Vector** is a vector that is used to determine the context of content or content publisher in a given search intent. It helps Google to profile the words used in a certain domain and differentiate the characteristics of different user behaviors.*
---
><a id="contextual-structure"></a>***Contextual Structure** refers to a data structure or framework that is used to maintain and organize topics relevant to an ongoing human-to-computer dialog. It helps in selecting the appropriate grammar and understanding the searcher's input in natural language. The contextual structure can be in the form of an undirected graph comprising nodes and edges, where each node represents a topic and stores information about the ongoing dialog related to that topic. The contextual structure allows for seamless pivoting between topics and helps the automated assistant respond effectively to the searcher's input.*
---
><a id="contextual-connection"></a>***Contextual Connection** refers to the relationship or link between different pieces of content or information based on their context. It involves connecting related topics, subtopics, or parent topics to explain the purpose of a possible link. The connection is established by matching the context, phrase patterns, predicates, nouns, and adjectives between documents to show similarity and ordering anchor tags. The goal is to provide a better understanding of the content and improve the relevance and navigation for users and search engines.*

## Lecture 15 - Contextual and Knowledge Domains


# Lecture 15 - Contextual and Knowledge Domains
- The Contextual understanding of a web document is built from the Queries

## How does a Search Engine process queries?
- **Functional Words**
    - Are used withint he question sentences regarding grammar and strcutre. they do not affect the search intent or subject of the question.
- **Concrete Words**
    - Are the 'core words' for a question. They directly relate to the searcer's intent.
- **User Inquiry Intent & Model**
    - Is similar to the 'search intent' or 'user's search intent' but the word "inquiry" is there because the model tries to understand the searcher's intent.
- **Subject Areas**
	- Are the most important term from K2Q. It is the 'slots for the concrete words' that the functional words will wrap to create a question according to the output of the User Inqury Model (UIM).

## Lecture 16 - Attribute Filtration and Criterias


# Lecture 16 - Attribute Filtration and Criterias
- Three Criteria of Entity-Attribute Pairs
    - Attribute Prominence
        - Coming from the deinition of the Entity (is it signifant?)
    - Attribute Popularity
        - Coming from the Search Demand (is it searched?)
    - Attribute Relevance
        - Relevance to the Source Context (is it admissible?)
- [Source](https:www.holisticseo.digital/seo-research-study/entity-attribute-value)
- Attributes that define Entities are more important 
    - than those that can be removed without reducing the Entity's definition
- No Population? No Germany. "Germany Population"
- Good Query Terms meet all 3 of the above

- H1 represents the [Macro Context](#macro-context)
- This specific H1, also represents the root of all other possible connections present within the website.
- Every other attribute and attribute-related document

## H1 - What to Know Before Going to Germany?
- Two predicates, one is "Know" the other is "Going"
- They both match the [Central Search Intent](#central-search-intent)
    - You ahve to reflect this in the Root Document
    - It will be able to create the rest of the [Contextual Vector](#contextual-vector)
-  Distribute the best attributes and search behaviors based on the Central Search Intent.
-  The [Contextual Structure](#contextual-structure) of each Heading serves not only as a breakdown of the writer's production of content, but also the 'bridge' in context to the following (or nested) headings.
-  Central Entity is selected and processed with our Attributes
-  Poor Root Documents discourage

## Lecture 18 - Contextual Vector and Question Generation


# Lecture 18 - Contextual Vector and Question Generation
- Questions help understand specific question and answer format
- If your answer is aligned, it becomes a question-answer pair
- Search engines can learn this question-type format
- Producing question based Headings give the Search Engine a question without it needing to assume one, improving responsiveness
- Understand the anchor text that is going to be utilized, and the Heading which will be needing the same answer
- The **Heading-Question** is often a Synonym of the **Anchor Text/Internal Link-Answer**
- Heading Levels are a determining factor in the 'weight' of the Internal Link being utilized
- Attributes are prioritized through Heading Level, which are expressed in priority as Internal Links.
- 'Lower Level' Headings open up additional context
```
- H5 contextualize H4
- H4 contextualize H3
- H3 contextualize H2
- H2 contextualize H1
- H1 contextualizes Meta Description
- Meta Description contextualizes Title
- Title contextualizes Slug
- Slug contextualizes Entity+Attribute
- Entity+Attribute contextualizes Query

- They don't appear in every city
## Unique (Serves as a Qualifier for the Entity)
- City - Istabul > Hagio Sophia, Paris > Eifel Tower
- A certain type of feature that can only appear for that city

> Koray went from Water > Water Quality > Water Benefits > nodes underneath this 

> If your website is able to outrank the topical authorities within query networks for a long time, you’re informing the search engine that your source is a website or brand that can give more accurate and rich information compared to the top authorities. If you outrank them for key attributes, for a long time, you will have an authority established. You can then go to the other topics easier.

> One of the first things that should be done within semantics, is to be clustered/classified with the top authorities (not to be associated with low quality sources in your niché). Hence, why Koray went with the harder topics first.

- 

> Expansion Of Entity-Attribute Pairs To Contextual Vectors/H1 Headings
> 
> Once you have an entity attribute pair, and a target query or query network
> 
> You will have to augment it further by choosing a predicate, adjective or other types of context terms or topical entries, in the macro context which will be reflected in the H1
> 
> Try to reflect the predicates further and further
> 
> The Attributes don’t always have to be explicitly stated, they can be implied.
> 
> These implications create other connections, and allow us to go further in other areas
> 
> From the beginning to the end of the topical map we stay within the same context (Water quality and benefits) - Sometimes by changing water type, water drinking time (morning, Afternoon) or water drinking condition (empty stomach) or another attribute (Water Heat)
> 
> When we use the different attributes within the same context, we try to see which query network we can directly target, and we continue with this consolidation.
> 
> Perfect Explanation - For why you can’t copy Svalbardi, and it only results in greater topical authority for them.
> 
> Example
> 
> Entity Attribute Pair - Water (Entity) and Benefit (Attribute) - Expanded to Benefits Of Drinking Water
> Different Title Tag Writing Methodologies (Also Touched On In Earlier Lectures)
> Implying the attribute within the question, and including the central entity in that question.
> 
> Example - water and overhydration - Expanded to What happens when you drink too much water? - Overhydration is the main consequence or state your body enters when drinking too much water, therefore it is somewhat implied in the question
> 
> Example - Water and optimum amount of water in the body - Expanded to What Percentage Of The Human Body Is Water?
> 
> Explicitly stating the entity-attribute pair, then expanding on how you’ll cover that entity attribute pair
> 
> Example - Water and (fluid) retention - Water (Fluid) Retention: Causes and Symptoms - The initial pair of water and retention, is then augmented as in to how it will be covered (the context) in terms of causes and symptoms - which i’m guessing will be in the main content of the article
> 
> Example - Water and Sparkling (Water) - Expanded to Sparkling Water: Benefits, Risks, and Facts
> 
> Using the entity and attribute pair as the heading
> 
> Example - Water and Quality - Expanded to Water Quality
> 
> Example - Water and contaminants - Expanded to Water Contaminants
> 
> A kind of Combination of 1 and 2 - With stating the entity attribute pair, and then asking a contextual question
> 
> Example - Water and Lemon (water) - Expanded into Lemon Water: What Are The Benefits Of Drinking It?

## Lecture 32 - Signaling the Macro-Context with IR Zones


# Lecture 32 - Signaling the Macro-Context with IR Zones
- 

> ## Image URLs 
> 
> - We don't use any stop, functional or contextual words, we only use the most important terms or phrases for the entity attribute pair (which could just be the entity attribute pair) for the image URL. We just change the order of the most important words 
>     
> - Example - Water-Microplastics from the heading: Microplastics in drinking water
>     
> - We might just switch the order in the entity attribute pair, from the heading into the image URL like in the above example.
>     
> - The purpose for restating the most important terms (entity attribute pair) is to ensure we are reflecting the main context - based on the phrases that can be generated from those words or phrases, the closer they’re to one another, the more overlap there is in the generation the more consolidation in the main context and topic.
> 
> ## Image Alt Tags 
> 
> - The Alt Tags include stop, functional and contextual words with the entity attribute pair. Koray typically gives the entity attribute pair with most important contextual terms, and functional words in the Alt Tag for it to make sense 
>     
> - If there are functional, contextual or any types of specific words within the queries that are very important, they should be included in the alt tags. 
>     
> - Ultimately Alt Tags are basically a rephrasing of the macro context (H1 title) 
>     
> - When you don’t want to dilute the context, due to an important quality node (most important article), you can restate the heading as an alt tag (exact match). When you add extra phrases or word sequences there will be an expansion in the context, considering there can be more possible phrases generated by google.     
> 
> ## Headline Images 
> 
> - The headline images on the article are important and must be indexed - can be checked by SRC Search Operator 
>     
> - Headline image uniqueness, quality and topicality, will help the article for further ranking 

## Lecture 33 - Limits and Optimization of Momentum


# Lecture 33 - Limits and Optimization of Momentum


> ## Publication Date/Frequency
> 
> - You want to find a somewhat ‘sweet spot’ where you are showing google, this is a human website, and the website is in a different state than previously (to increase crawl rate).
>     
> - Koray published 20 articles in Svalbard, to show the search engine, there is a big difference in the current state from the previous state. A big difference will differ from website to website, as a website with 5 pages, would have a monumentally big change with 20 articles then a 10,000 page website would. To ensure that google will have to rerank and look at the source again, we want google to see a big change in state.
>     
> - Koray chose to publish twenty relative to the URL count of the website, which would be a substantial change relative to that website in terms of the ‘state’
>     
> 
> ## Different Publication Frequency ‘Strategies’
> 
> - You can publish a lot of articles suddenly (Hundreds of articles), and do so consistently. Considering, Generative AI (Chat GPT), google and bing removed the websites.
>     
> - Publish a batch together (20 - 60), then go to smaller quantities in a parternless way 
>     
> - Then you can publish one by one or a smaller quantity way - Two in a day, 5 in a day, 1 a day, a few days in between then 1 then another the next day etc (patternless). 
>     
> 
> - Go for the most important topics
>     
> - Go back and fix the internal links (when you publish the articles)
>     
> - The initial ranking of content is also dependent upon the neighbourhood content (related content of the other articles), the ranking boost that will come in initial ranking will come after a certain point of historical data.
>     
> - More historical data will accrue with the longer you take to publish your articles (one by one approach), will increase initial ranking, because there is more historical data (Impressions, Clicks, Search behaviours, and query search sessions), since crawl rate is increased it will increase initial ranking.

## Lecture 34 - Central Entity and Source Context (Quality Nodes)


# Lecture 34 - Central Entity and Source Context (Quality Nodes)

> ## Example - Topical Map - Project - Svalbardi
> 
> Central Entity - Water
> 
> Source Context: Selling Luxury water - Not only luxury water it’s an arctic water brand - Joining luxury and arctic water together you obtain the most important entity attribute pair of water quality - Considering what separates all other types of water from Svalbardi, is the fact it is ‘luxury’, implies that the water is of superior quality and better than majority of ‘regular’ water. Thus, they charge larger amounts of money for the water. Hence, water quality is the most important attribute of water for Svalbardi because it is the most important part of their source context, and justifies the price they sell their water to consumers (which the price also contributes to them being a luxury water as well). 
> 
> Central Search Intent - ‘Drinking Water’ - Site wide N Grams, Phrases, Topical and Contextual Entries - Drinking Water (CSN) is reflected in the root of the semantic content network and the root of the root of the semantic content network. 
> 
> ## Content Brief
> 
> Three Query Columns For Quality Nodes - Exceeding The Quality Thresholds
> 
> 1. First column comes from the queries that the first ranking page on the SERP - First one is an education website - 
> 2. The second column is slightly different from the first; it is the source we are trying to outrank and be clustered within the search engine’s indexes. If we’re able to outrank them we will be classified with them, and will attain a topical authority status.
> 3. The third column is for different phrase taxonomies, variations and combinations are the different phrase sequences of the same context (different [contextual layers](https:docs.google.com/document/d/12Q3pyo7Q8lavyPrmlTBXCc1KRwOMcqrUneN8FAOdI2s/edit?fbclid=IwAR1vrmkA19RZFcZtpHcCdtASFE9qlyfA2Pl4TQkbO0QYNIz-VEVSTfR_UTo#heading=h.k28252fatazf)) 
>     
> ## Purpose Of The Three Columns 
> 
> 1. Most of the priority is for the first column. It’s important for question generation and contextual vector creation 
> 
> 2. The second column is for taking various context terms from that area to outrank that source
> 3. The third column is for different anchor texts, based upon the different attributes inside the queries.
> 
> ## Extra Tips 
> 
> - In analysing a search query, we must ‘feel the denses’, You must be able to sense the difference in the density or the weight of a particular word or words in a phrase sequence, and figure out whether the weight of these words fit within its own page. 
> - If additional words within the root query/context don’t have any value,weight or density, it can mean they’re addressed within the root query and context, meaning that other query doesn’t need to be addressed individually within its own context. 

## Lecture 35 - Contextual Vector Construction from Different Web Sources


# Lecture 35 - Contextual Vector Construction from Different Web Sources
- 


> ## Considerations 
> 
> - When we are attempting to outrank the source we are targeting it’s important to balance our ‘uniqueness’ to an extent. If we are too unique (different consensus, writing in a different manner), it will be very hard to achieve rankings for that page and query network. 
>     
> - Search engines don’t have a perception of the fact, they just have the consensus from authority sources. The 2nd column query list (the source we are trying to be clustered with) is for taking initial approval from the Search engine, when we have the state of authority, is when we are able to distort/alter what the search engine perceives as a fact. 
> 
> ## Structure In The Contextual Vector 
> 
> - The use of the numeric value in H1 and title tags, increasing ‘rankings’ and ‘CTR’
> 
> - Example - 20 Health Benefits Of Drinking Water: Physical, Psychological, and Nutritional 
>     
> - The most important phrase sequence and Central Search Intent (CSI) directly there ‘Benefits Of Drinking Water’ - CSI is Drinking water
>     
> - The most important attribute of the central entity (Water) is there as well ‘benefits’ 
>     
> - Then there’s a specification of context with the use of the number 20, and outlining what type of benefits are going to be given. Ie; ‘health’ ‘physical’ ‘psychological’ ‘Nutritional’ 
> 
> - In alignment with the context of the H1, the corresponding predicates should also mimic the ‘tone’ of the context in the h1
> 
> - Example - The word benefit or benefits is positive in tonality, and describes the positive aspects of something. Therefore, the corresponding predicates in relation to the tonality of the contextual term (in this case benefits), should also follow suit. 
>     
> - The use of the predicates like ‘improves’ ‘increases’ ‘Helps’ ‘Treats’ ‘Prevents’ are positive and follow the tone set in the h1. Ensuring, we have a consistent and straight contextual vector flow.
>     
> - If It was 20 harms of…… You’d use negative tonality in the following heading such as; decreases, reduces, causes, breaks, effects.
> 
> - Address the most important derived attribute, of the most important entity attribute pair 
> 
> - The following headings also address the important derived attribute of health from benefits, and the derived benefits from health which are physical, psychological and nutritional. 
>     
> - The headings use important derived attributes of physical, psychological, and nutritional in the following 20 numbers - Such as; ‘Physical Performance’ ‘Brain Function’ ‘Weight Loss’ ‘Depression etc
>     
> - Then comes the importance of distributing the different derived attributes/unnamed entities in a logical order, that also justifies ur H1, while staying in the same context identified in the H1 (‘Health Benefits’).
>     
> - Creating small word sequences, with word proximity then the order, with predicate and noun, justifying the H1.

## Lecture 36 - Macro and Micro Contextual Vectors


# Lecture 36 - Macro and Micro Contextual Vectors
## Incremental Heading Order List
> 
> - Koray utilises mainly a ‘incremental heading order list’  within the main content headings, as the headings incrementally increase in an order 
> 
> - The last heading is less important than the first heading in an incremental heading order list, considering numbers are being used.  Utilising numbers is also for featured snippets.
> 
> - When you create a ‘quality passage’ it increases the total quality of your source
> 
> - A colon in the h1 heading means that the second section is completed and signified by the first section. The second part  is interpreted in the context of the first 
> 
> - The order of the context terms (Physical,Psychological, Nutritional)  in the H1 after the colon comes from the queries
> - We also reiterate the macro context formed in the H1, by sticking to the order established in the H1 Heading,
> 
> - Placing one of the physical benefits first; ‘physical performance’, ensures we are reiterating the macro context
> 
> - Then placing a psychological benefit next is also the same: ‘Brain Function’ 
> 
> - We should also have a bridges between each part of the heading to another
> 
> - There is a bridge between physical and psychological which is ‘increases energy’
> 
> - We should augment the phrases and the context in accordance with the queries
> 
> - In this case physical performance will signal the word ‘body’
> 
> - ‘Brain function will signal mental health or mental efficiency’ 
> 
> - Semantically, there is a lexical relationship between the brain and the body, but we take our meanings from the queries, not the real world.
> 
> - We choose a macro context, and we order the incremental list based on it, and we try to consolidate a contextual domain, by keeping the closely related benefits together. Also, the sequence in which we list the order list (or benefits in this case), must also make sense with one another (Hydration and a Hangover are causes of one another).
> 
> - In the top/main areas we attempt to unite the context for the most important aspect health being physical, and in the middle or less important parts we 
> 
> - Even if we have water mainly in our H1, we will need to take the alternatives or similarities of water, or similar or alternatives of the predicate drinking to stay in the context and go deeper
>     
> ## Topical Map Effect 
> - If we take the terms from the headings of the different articles in the processed topical map, we will see the most important words are reflected in the headings (Water, Benefits, Drinking), the other terms (Harms,Effects,Pro’s, Cons, causes, symptoms, other types of water (lemon water etc)) are all connected to these terms 
> - When we create the list of benefits, we must also use them as a criterion for other types of water 
> - We don’t say contradicting statements, and we don’t forget what has been stated in other articles or topical maps

> - The supplementary content is used to process the micro contexts
> - There is a bridge between the macro and micro contexts, and the main and supplementary content

> ## Bridge Between Supplementary and Main Content
> - There is a bridge/border or as Koray [states earlier](https:docs.google.com/document/d/12Q3pyo7Q8lavyPrmlTBXCc1KRwOMcqrUneN8FAOdI2s/edit?fbclid=IwAR1vrmkA19RZFcZtpHcCdtASFE9qlyfA2Pl4TQkbO0QYNIz-VEVSTfR_UTo#heading=h.iphoj4t7zev0), a clear distinction where main content ends and supplementary content begins. The bridge is the point between these two points (Main content ends and Supplementary content begins). The bridge is also the border between macro context and main content and micro contexts and supplementary content
> - In the example the most important question (How much water should you drink a day) for this root is asked as segway/bridge/border onto the supplementary content. In order to unite two different contexts to minimise the amount of pages created (applies to new web sources). 
>     
> - We directly reflect the specific questions context, in the macro context, then ask the specific question as a border/bridge.
> 
> - Considering the question is ‘How much water should you drink a day?’ the benefits of drinking the amount of water you should drink a day, should give you the benefits of water, processed in the macro context
> 
> - We further deepen our questions, in the context of the main question, by using a H3 and asking a more specific question. Then proceed with Boolean questions for important contextual layers for our contextual domain.
>     
> - What are the benefits of drinking water in the morning?
>     
> - Should you drink water before sleep?
>     
> - Should you drink water before dinner?
>     
> - Should you drink water during dinner?
> 
> - We also continue to sharpen until we have covered the question in its entirety, and we touch on the relevant micro contexts that will serve as our contextual connections (internal links) for our other parts of our topical map. 
>     
> - Repeat again of utilising antonym contexts at the bottom of the article in the supplementary content (increases relevance) 
>     
> - If we use a number in the h1 heading, if we use the antonym of the context in the supplementary content, we should use another number in the anchor text (especially if it appears in the queries) 
>     
> - The bridge also serves the purpose of being root and roof for the supplemental content. 
>     
> - Once we ask a question as the bridge we ask a question.
>     
> 
> ## General ‘Rules’ 
> 
> - Macro context processed in main content
>     
> - Micro Contexts processed in supplementary content
>     
> - Between them there is a border 
>     
> - When we choose a source to decrease it’s overall authority we take the context terms, from it’s queries that it’s ranking for, and place it at the beginning part (macro context) 
>     
> - We also reflect our main targeted query network in the main content/context, and also inside the bridge
> - We don’t really link from the macro context (unless we are linking to a very specific page, that we also do in other root articles), The most important, and relevant internal links inside the main content with distance between them. The lower we go in the contextual hierarchy (H3,H4 etc) the more internal links we have in these sections with less distance.


## Lecture 38 - Contextual Hierarchy and Connections


# Lecture 38 - Contextual Hierarchy and Connections
- 


> ## Contextual Hierarchy 
> 
> - The heading hierarchy is akin to a semantic content network brief template. Considering we typically replicate the hierarchy.
> 
> - When using an incremental order heading list, we will always have the same hierarchy for other root articles.
>     
> - Boolean questions are used for the voice search, considering they’re very easy to answer, this allows for us to take greater historical data from voice search and will b e reflected on web search.
>     
> - If we can rank in voice search, and obtain greater historical data it will serve the whole article better for ranking as a whole. 
> 
> ## Contextual Connections
> 
> - Koray will provide the anchor text and will say ‘relevant article’, for the author as a test to ensure that the anchor text is relevant and is a signal for what they’re going to click on. If the author doesn’t understand which article to link in this place it’s an indicator for the anchor text to change. 
>     
> - The purpose of giving distance between internal links, especially in the main content is too increase clickability, and for the search engines to understand the importance/prominence of the link
>     
> - When we increase clickability and it being ‘early’ within the content, it has more prominence.
>     
> - We process the queries, through taking the [three columns](https:docs.google.com/document/d/12Q3pyo7Q8lavyPrmlTBXCc1KRwOMcqrUneN8FAOdI2s/edit?fbclid=IwAR1vrmkA19RZFcZtpHcCdtASFE9qlyfA2Pl4TQkbO0QYNIz-VEVSTfR_UTo#heading=h.4yxfbynjcuza) of queries, and generating questions and distributing them. We create a proper macro context, then contextual vector, then a contextual hierarchy, and distributing contextual connections
>     
> - The article methodology might cause changes in the contextual vector.

## Lecture 39 - Contextual Structure Analysis and Flow


# Lecture 39 - Contextual Structure Analysis and Flow

> ## Article Methodology - Contextual Structure
> - In the contextual structure, we outline the contextual flow, the contextual direction, context terms, proceeding questions, format of the content, tonality of the content, entity connections (in a particular way), sentence structures, and phrase taxonomies or sequences
>     
> - Definitions are very important, considering changing a single word's definition changes, all the semantic answers, generated questions, and relevance will change, making other sources more and less relevant.
>     
> - The contextual structure outlines all the micro semantics, and the small but important changes to things like; word proximity, word co-occurrences, word sequences, and semantic role labels.
> 
> ## Relation To AI
> - Considering that chatgpt will be unable to understand this prompting, it will distort the word sequences, perplexity and burstiness. It will use certain types of definition for certain types of context transitions it will be easy to understand that is a generative AI

## Lecture 40 - Contextual Structure with Algorithmic Rules


## General Considerations For The Contextual Structure 

- We must define our most important predicate, and central entity with more details, perspectives, and highest level of scientific knowledge relative to our competitors. If we are able to define our most important section/entities, within the knowledge base of google, better than our competitors we will always have higher relevance.
    
- If google obtains the definition (like drinking water) of your most important entity from your source, they will interpret the query, and augmenting the query based off your import
    
- The same with product search, if you are able to create better attribute definitions for certain products (related to your business), better than your competitors, meaning they’re taking the definition of these attributes from your source. If your competitors don’t use the true definition (comes from your source), that comes from the topical authoritative source 
    
- We need to be summative and less comprehensive in the introduction. 
    
- Our purpose is to give the main context, which comes from the first definition. Then we focus on a certain attribute, then we define the activity or process then give the main benefit and reiterate on it. We minimise the specificity of the answers given.
    

  

## How To Structure The Introduction

1. We are essentially mimicking the macro context in its order in a summative manner - Basically informing the search engine what is coming, and in what order in this article.
    
2. Initially there is a definition for the most important entity
    

- Definition of a type of water - ‘Drinking water’ - not the action
    

3. Then we proceed onto the most important aspect of the entity attribute pair
    

- The main benefit of drinking water - also including any important notes like scientific terms 
    

4. Then we provide supporting evidence in the form of the main physical, and psychological benefits, that are also a consolidation of the macro context in the h1 heading.
    
5. We then mention the final type of health benefit ‘nutritional’ and identify its nutritional value
    
6. Then we see drinking waters function for the body
    
7. Then we provide further consolidation by asking an important and related question: How many percent of the human body is water?
    

  

# Lecture 41 - Extractive and Abstractive Summary

## Extractive and Abstractive Summary 

- Everything in the article methodology for an introduction (first paragraph or paragraphs before the first H2) those things will be talked about, mentioned and processed throughout the article in the corresponding sections (H2’s).
    
- The intro is the general summary section for an article
    

Extractive Summary - is the summary that is created with the extracted declarations from the different subsections of an article.

Abstractive Summary - is modifying existing sentences in the key parts of an article, and using it for summarising the entire article

- To be able to give an abstractive or extractive summary, we need the rest of the article (headings, and key phrases, and talking points)
    
- If our General Summary doesn’t flow and is ‘discordant’ then this will make the rest of the article discordant, and less relevant to one another. 
    

Extractive Summary + Abstractive Summary = General Summary

  

### Process For Applying The Extractive and Abstractive Summary

- We will need to create an abstractive summary, which means we will need to imagine the rest of the article in an abstract way. Then we will need to write the introduction for the article
    
- Then we will need to check the intro and conclusion, after the article has been written.
    
- Then we will need to extract (the most important) key points, and distribute them to the summary
    
- We will need to tell our authors, following the order of the article methodology is crucial. 
    

1. Abstractive Summary - Imagine the article complete and write the intro.
    
2. Macro Context (main content)
    
3. Supplementary Content (micro contexts)
    
4. Extract key points further from the Macro and Micro contexts and move them to the general summary part
    
5. We then check if there is proper contextual flow, and no discordance between the intro and the other parts. 
    
6. If there is discordance we continue to configure these sections, and the intro to ensure everything is a straight line with no interuptions, that reflects we stay on the same topic while processing everything with no gap.
    

  

## Basic Rules

- The use of quotation marks - Indicates to the author they will need to distribute the specific phrase sequences without breaking them, with proper grammar structure, the author will need to give unique information, without gibberish, and repetition.
    

- This will ensure the author will be following the proper contextual vector, context terms and always giving unique information
    
- Phrases are important for a few reasons: Internal linking, Word Proximity, and word co-occurrence 
    
- If the phrase appears within the anchor text or one of contextual vectors (Headings), and they don’t appear in the macro context introduction, then the contextual vector isn’t straight, and flowing correctly.)
    
- The utilisation of these quotation marks is to give the authors context hints in the article methodology to ensure they use these phrases properly.
    

- Sample sentences - we also in quotation marks provide sample sentences for the authors to ensure they are able to understand, to ensure they also use certain types of contextual terms in that section of the article. 
    

  

# Lecture 42 - Contextual Structure for Entities from Same Class

## Article Methodology For The Main Content

- When you have an incremental heading order list, each part of the incremental heading (1,2,3 etc) will be answered by the same ‘criterion’, meaning we will answer the same questions for each heading.
    

- Example - We Define X (X being every heading in the list), then we answer how drinking water provides this benefit.
    

- We must Define everything we are talking about within the context of a particular heading 
    

- Example - ‘Increasing Physical Performance’ - We must include the definition of physical performance, and the definition of ‘increasing physical performance’
    

- Before using an internal link, always create a ‘justification’ for the relevance of the internal link, prior to using it
    

- Koray will use the terms that are being used in the anchor text of an internal link, at least 1-5 times before inserting the internal link, and anchor text.
    

## Order Of The Article Methodology For Answering The Question

1. Context Hints - Define X, How does water provide this benefit?, How Long It Affects It?, What Is The Proof Of It (Criterion), Mention entity names and their connection to each other
    
2. Order Hints - Physical Performance, Important Synonym Predicates (Improves,Increases, Develops, makes better etc), and certain effects 
    
3. Question and Sentence Examples/Structures
    

  

# Lecture 43 - Contextual Border

## More Rules

- ‘Exact Definitive Answer’ - Means the first sentence used to answer the question, will be giving the answer directly, precisely, and with certainty. 
    

-  Meaning we aren’t giving the answer with a ‘modality’ - Like should, may, might or can when giving the answer, we directly give the fact
    

- ‘Expansion Of Evidence’ - We expand the answer further with evidence, as a form of support, using different types of representatives of the main answers.
    

- We are also giving different types of phrase sequences with different context variations
    

- Also provide relevant extras - measurements, and different considerations
    
- List definition - Which means using a sentence to define a list. Use a full sentence when defining a list
    
- ‘Descriptive List Definition’ - Giving a different and variative, definition of the benefits of drinking water, in a way you can connect the section, and the following headings/sections, by giving criterion
    
- Listing - A list is utilised to answer the particular heading/contextual vector.
    

- We outline the total number of list elements (how many answers on the list)
    

# Lecture 44 - Micro Semantics

## Supplementary Content

- Considering, the most important format should be used on the most important webpage, we typically use a paragraph format in the supplementary content. 
    

## The Importance Of Using The Correct Format

- If you have a ‘macro context’ match for a specific query network, use the correct format in that article, not everywhere (so you don’t compete with your own answer), in order to inform google this part is just a supporting page, and evidence for the ‘proper’ answer, in the internal link.
    
- Using the correct format, for the proper answer is crucial as a signal for google, to inform them, that this is the most important answer for that question, in order to avoid competing with ur own answers (keyword or passage cannibalisation)
    
- In addition, we will reduce the comprehensiveness of the answer given for that representative question, or will ask a variant of the question, that requires a less comprehensive answer, in the web page that isn’t supposed to rank for that query network
    

# Lecture 45 - Predicates, Nouns, and Distributing Contextual Relevance

- In order to be more relevant to the main query network, we must process the alternative contexts to the individual query network (Predicate, and qualifier). Using the alternatives as substitute contexts for it 
    
- Content item briefs aren’t static prior to creation of the articles, they are dynamic and change in alignment with the other nodes, seeds, roots (articles) and queries. Especially, as it pertains to anchor text (contextual connections), Contextual Hierarchy and contextual vectors (headings)
    

- Anchor text changes from 9 to 14 signs you’re drinking too much water
    

- We can distribute the ‘left over’ context terms that aren’t mentioned within the supplementary content (bottom part)
    

# Lecture 46 - Conditional Synonym Phrases in Macro Contexts

Contextual Vector - Micro and Macro Context Based On The Queries

- The main H1 heading is a conditional synonym phrase, with the answer and is the search query that appears the most in the queries - What happens when you drink too much water? (Water Intoxication) 
    
- The first Anchor text, and structured piece of content (list, table etc) 
    
- If you want to increase relevance and ranking, the first structured content, should always be within the macro context - Typically on the most important context (Attribute) 
    
- Too Much Water is a synonym of Water intoxication, in the real world, however, it’s crucial to be able to see this within the queries (Koray is unable to do so), if you’re able to look through the queries and find a different word sequence, that is apart of that query network, it means that google has identified this as a synonym for main phrase or keyword for that query network, and is therefore good to use as a synonym. However, if we are unable to see it in the queries, it is a decision that needs to be considered. 
    
- We can attempt to fix Google's perception of a topical, and increasing topical consolidation by creating multiple pages for different query networks where necessary. Even if there is some overlap between the web pages that rank for these queries, there is a need for this distinction.
    

# Lecture 47 - Contextual Consolidation within Vectors

- Koray’s purpose for using H2’s (or in this case) is to have borders, and consolidations for certain sections - The H2’s answer the H1, The H3’s answer the H2’s, and the H4’s answer the H3’s
    
- Based upon the importance of a particular H2, we are able to expand the context and sharpen it further with h3’s, h4’s and other types of questions to ensure we are completely covering that part of the query network, based on the search demand and [filtration of the attributes](https:docs.google.com/document/d/12Q3pyo7Q8lavyPrmlTBXCc1KRwOMcqrUneN8FAOdI2s/edit?fbclid=IwAR1vrmkA19RZFcZtpHcCdtASFE9qlyfA2Pl4TQkbO0QYNIz-VEVSTfR_UTo#heading=h.k7x2k2cuql2p).
    
- The way we rank certain things in an order, that aren’t sequential, is through their popularity (overall) and popularity to the entity
    
- Ensure we give more ‘Symptoms’ or more of the key attribute for that particular sub section
    
- H3’s get there context from the ‘root’ question in the H2
    
- We always want to focus on antonyms (or opposites) within the supplementary content
    
- We always should use a query template and use the most important context for it
    

# Lecture 48 - Knowledge-base Construction within Definitions

## Outline Of Intro

1. We begin with a definition of the macro context and the main entity
    
2. We go to the main sections (or samples of the attributes given)
    
3. We then give the justification (especially for the relevant bridges), for our contextual connections 
    
4. All done in the order of the article
    

## Considerations

- The purpose of the intro is to justify the whole article in terms of order, and internal links, and lay the foundations/preview of what is to come
    
- Especially sub context sections (H2’s) must always be reflected in the intro, in the same order.
    

# Lecture 49 - Balancing Contextual Coverage 

- The purpose of not addressing the most important context of symptoms, straight away, is to increase relevance to the contextual vector (of symptoms) and to rank for the question template, or question query. Hence we expand on the question with the representatives of that question
    
- We do minimise the amount/length of content within the less important parts in the main content
    
- Defining what we are talking about before, we begin talking about it
    
- The H2’s act as ‘sub articles’, and summaries of the h3 in a sense
    

## Another rule

- Preceding question 
    
- Using positive language within the YMYL niche, will help for further rankings
    

  
  

# Lecture 50 - Structuring Context with Macro and Micro Semantics

- We have to ensure that our supplementary section isn't too irrelevant from the main content. Hence, Koray links back to the main content at the end of the article.
    
- The specific context, phrases, and keywords in the macro context (H1), will appear throughout the webpage/article, but the words that appear in particular sections won’t appear in the following sections. But there is always a mention of the macro context, context terms in conjunction with other micro contexts.
    

- For example - The phrase ‘drinking too much water’, and ‘water intoxication’, will be mentioned throughout the whole article, considering they’re the macro context.
    
- Key phrases or context terms that relate to subsections like nausea, or the colour of urine, will be mentioned within it’s section, but will not extend past it’s section. 
    
- The only exception to the rule, might be justifying your internal links (contextual connections). 
    

  

# Lecture 51 - Turning Queries into Headings

## The Query Lists For Content item briefs 

- The query lists are ordered based upon according to the order that the keywords rank for the particular URL’s
    

## What happens if the queries are explicit questions?

- We will need to deepen the question context, and ask different variations of the specific questions
    
- After determining the specific macro context (H1), we then begin to variate the question, based on the most important contexts (think lexical relations).
    
- Koray touches on sub parts of the macro context, then siblings of the macro context, in variating the question in the macro context
    

## Contextual Connection 

- This contextual connection to the root article, isn’t mentioned in the introduction, but it’s mentioned within the supplementary content, and it’s micro context
    
- The purpose of it being given within a boolean question and a H4 is because, it allows for a more specific anchor text, and also signifies less relevance to be passed through the internal link
    

  

# Lecture 52 - Including Answer Terms with Contextual Flow

## Article Methodology - Intro

- Defining the most important entity and word sequence, identified in the macro context, at the onset of the article
    
- Then we answer the most important question, related to our topic/macro context
    
- Overall, we are trying to reflect the macro and micro contexts we are going to discuss, we try to implement them within the order they are addressed, as much as possible.
    

## Featured Snippets - Overall Article

- In the featured snippets, information density is very important - Even if someone asks for the male percentage, we include the female percentage (or the ‘sibling’ context).
    
- Koray utilises very similar questions with only a different gender inserted, in order to be able to ‘grab’ both the female and male snippets.
    
- He further optimises this with his sentence structure, by ensuring the dominant context he is ‘pursuing’ (male or female in this case), is emphasised in the question, and the sentence structure giving more weight to the particular context term, then the less important context term based on the question. 
    
- Koray also talks about his ‘bridge’, where he discusses the water percentage in animal bodies, he compares animal bodies to human bodies, utilising numerical values, and percentages. This is crucial as it relates to click satisfaction scores, and understanding your questions, considering the question explicitly states the need for a percentage, including percentages, numerical values, key words or phrases related to a percentage or the change in it (increase, decrease etc), will increase click satisfaction scores possibilities. 
    

# Lecture 53 - Matching and Signalling Anchor Text Terms

## Contextual Connection Justification 

- Koray uses a different then previously mentioned, he utilises the heading to signal/signify that the result, as a result of the process also in the contextual vector, is related to a larger subset (benefits), therefore justifying it’s placement there. This makes sense as ‘losing weight’ is one benefit of drinking water, hence there is some relevance between the question, answer, and contextual connection. I think this is also the purpose for the h4 heading because it’s relevant but not the most relevant, also indicated by the h4. 
    
- Answer terms - the terms used to answer certain questions 
    
- Koray utilises the answer terms to signify, and therefore justify the context he is referring to within the contextual vector 
    

- Utilising body functions within the h2 above, which is an answer term for the benefits, to justify internal linking.
    

## Hidden Columns

- Unique Information Gain Score
    
- Preceding question
    
- Annotation text
    

  

# Lecture 54 - Using Boolean Questions in Queries

## Contextual Vector - Boolean Question

- If you have a heading with a boolean question, we add certain contextual terms (risks and benefits in this case) to the heading (to expand the context to write an article I assume) of our macro context, for an explicit question query. 
    
- The more we increase the similarity between query vocabulary (And semantic role labels), and document vocabulary, the greater the information retrieval score (no matter the iteration of IR). 
    
- If we have a boolean question in our macro context, we should use the similar variations within our contextual hierarchy (will help for ranking). 
    
- To emphasise a contextual connection (internal link), using a variation of the macro context of that other webpage, to justify linking it within that page.
    
- With a boolean question as our macro context, the length of the article remains shorter, similar to the answer of the boolean question. 
    

# Lecture 55 - Consolidating Contextual Relevance

## Analysis Of Queries For Contextual Vector Creation

- Koray takes a general look at the queries, and sees the consistent contextual terms that are within the queries, then checks (through Ctrl + F) the variations, and context terms of the query network.
    
- This allows Koray to utilise ‘distributional semantics’, where the most important context terms within the queries (also based on the number of times they appear in the query network), must be included in some sense within the contextual vector.
    
- Based on themes of the words, even if a word appears within the terms more than another, we may use a synonym instead, if the theme (more relevant to our knowledge domain) of the synonym is more relevant than the one in the queries. 
    

## Quality Nodes

- The purpose of a quality node is supposed to be a webpage, that we prove our quality and authority relative to our competitors
    
- Quality nodes are extremely long, and detailed
    
- As opposed to a boolean question webpage, it’s only for ranking for that query (hence it’s less detailed and shorter).
    

# Lecture 56 - Using Antonyms for Contextual Bridges

## Justifying Contextual Connections 

- Utilising the phrase in the heading that we are going to use in our anchor text allows for greater justification relevance, and pagerank to be passed through our internal links.
    
- If we are able to use the phrases that will appear in the next heading, in the previous headings paragraphs (or subordinate text), will allow for greater justification of contextual flow, and greater 
    
- Stick with consensus given by the authoritative sources, at least until we are an authority ourselves
    
- A lot of these micro ‘configurations’ (micro semantics), are crucial to the contextual flow, between the macro context, bridge, and micro context, along with the justification of contextual connections to other content pieces within our topical map. 
    

# Lecture 57 - Phrase Sequences and Distributional Semantics

- Koray utilises colons within the headings to ensure majority of the relevance calculation is given towards the first part of the heading (before the colon)
    

- Drinking Hot Water: Health Benefits and Risks
    

- The part after the colon is to signal the flow, and sequence of the article
    
- We check those queries, and use the overall weight, and context of those queries, and a look at the documents to help generate the best contextual vectors
    

# Lecture 58 - Using Multiple Content Format in a Single Web Document

## Contextual Vector Adjustments

- If we ask a question with the term ‘what’, with a plural term inside that question, and the question doesn’t require for us to explain something methodological, or a cause or result, we just go with the ‘nouns’ (the named entities) that are most relevant to our particular section.
    
- Considering, less words within the heading allows for greater ‘weight’ to be distributed in the [embeddings](https:en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding) of the particular words within the relevance calculations. 
    
- To increase the relevance further, we use these terms within our headings earlier
    
- We are always finding efficient contexts to connect, and transition from different micro contexts to one another. For example from Benefits to risks, we use misunderstandings (it’s somewhat neutral between the two).
    
- The more we use a particular ‘phrase/word sequence’ and the topical terms throughout our websites entirety, the more relevance sitewide to the particular topic.
    

# Lecture 60 - Creating Information Extraction Points

## Key Configurations Within The Article

- The Introduction of this quality node is the same for as the one given in the root article, with a following of the order of the article, and a definition of the most important phrase/part of our macro context (H1) (Drinking Hot Water), along with our [extractive and abstractive](https:docs.google.com/document/d/12Q3pyo7Q8lavyPrmlTBXCc1KRwOMcqrUneN8FAOdI2s/edit?fbclid=IwAR1vrmkA19RZFcZtpHcCdtASFE9qlyfA2Pl4TQkbO0QYNIz-VEVSTfR_UTo#heading=h.q2owp58i3zsh) summary
    
- The purpose of placing our answer within the grouper question (as a list), and within our contextual hierarchy as a list, is for increasing the chance of a featured snippet 
    
- Let the h2 be a summary for the h3’s, especially if they’re list
    
- Order for the list (of benefits) is given based upon the [attribute filtration](https:docs.google.com/document/d/12Q3pyo7Q8lavyPrmlTBXCc1KRwOMcqrUneN8FAOdI2s/edit?fbclid=IwAR1vrmkA19RZFcZtpHcCdtASFE9qlyfA2Pl4TQkbO0QYNIz-VEVSTfR_UTo#heading=h.cee3viqjjp71) discussed before hand
    

# Lecture 61 - Sequence Modeling and Canonical Queries

## Unique N Grams - Sequence Modelling

- When inspecting or processing a query network, we will realise some of them are canonical or representative queries.
    
- Google is able to predict or assign a probability of the next or proceeding word in a sentence, or query based upon the words already used, otherwise known as sequence modelling.
    
- Google also use this for ‘query refinements’ 
    
- If we are able to give unique ‘n-grams’ with unique phrases, we are perceived as an authority, as we are able to give unique and new information.
    
- We are able to use different lexical relationships (specifically hyponyms), to provide these unique n grams, particularly if there are some of these context terms that are in the query, we can use them and variate them further based on lexical relations to provide ‘unique n-grams’.
    
- We should do this within the supplementary content, when the queries are really clear in relation to the contexts (contextual signals), that they want discussed for that query network
    
- We must ensure there is a proper contextual flow, by ensuring that our main content (that discusses particular contexts) is logically, and fluently linked to the supplementary content or parts where we can provide unique n grams and unite different ideas, and concepts to prove our topical authority
    

# Lecture 62 - Reading Query Networks

## Analysing Query Networks

- When choosing a webpage, that we are ‘targeting’ for creating our contextual vector, we must ensure that the webpage isn’t ranking just for ‘pagerank’ (or exogenous factors), we must choose a page that is ranking because of its overall and proven topical authority, and unique information.
    
- From a broad perspective, in our contextual vector, we are trying to align the various different word sequences (phrases) that are contextually associated with our base macro context (or the most important phrase in our macro context). This is based on sequence modelling where we are connecting the most probable, next words or previous words that will appear alongside our macro context phrase
    

- For example the context and subsequent phrase of ‘ph of drinking water’ appears to be the most important context (hence it’s the macro context), and is connected to different phrases throughout like ‘high ph drinking water’ ‘low ph drinking water’, but under the guise of particular aspects like harms.
    

# Lecture 63 - Using Multiple Contextual Domains in Main Content

## Arrangement Of The Contextual Vector

- If we have an image ‘annotation’ in the contextual structure, and we use the particular phrase within our paragraphs we will need to generate the actual image
    
- We utilise our supplementary content to build our contextual bridges for the justification of our internal links
    

# Lecture 64 - Connecting Attributes of Central Entity

## Micro Semantic Configurations For Our Article

- Within the intro Koray defines the pH of water, then goes on to define what pH is on its own without the context of water. This showcases the importance of defining our core concepts of our article, and the slight differences of the concept in a different context
    
- If we are able to use the key concepts we are discussing within our images (in a chart or whatever the image is), then it will help for further relevance, and responsiveness, for being served on google
    
- Query Networks (unless they’re an explicitly question network) will typically have a few or multiple representative queries, that are representative of the query network, the contexts, and the main topics, and sub topics that need to be addressed within the article
    

# Lecture 65 - Data to Website

- Justifying the internal link/contextual connection by placing it in an earlier paragraph doesn’t just mean placing the exact phrase that is being used in the anchor text, it means inserting the predicate earlier 
    
- Since it takes time to process certain parts of our topical map, we should include the definition of all the main entities (nouns), sitewide to ensure greater relevance, and connection to the proper parts of the parts of the topical map that we are going to touch on in the future
    

## How to Approach A Content Brief

1. Focus on the context 
    
2. Context Connections 
    
3. Connect everything to query semantics
    
4. Then lexical semantics
    

# Lecture 66 - Auditing Article Relevance and Responsiveness

## Examining Transference Of Content Brief to Article

1. Koray places the article and the brief next to one another on a singular page
    
2. Check The Headings if they match the brief
    
3. The headings hierarchy - h1,h2 etc
    
4. Check each paragraph under each heading, in conjunction with the article methodology
    

## Article Considerations and Author Rules

- Koray doesn’t allow the authors to edit the contextual vector, especially the order of the ‘nouns’ or named entities, or the predicates, but might allow for some changes in the methodology 
    
- Koray recommends to ensure the h2 heading, the font size, and weight, aren’t bigger than the h1, when going deeper in the hierarchy using 4 pixel smaller and lower font weight
    
- Koray typically uses three examples when introducing a key concept, or giving a contextual connection
    
- We are trying to be connected to all different contexts by optimising word proximity and co-occurrences
    

# Lecture 67 - Auditing Order of Declarations and Completeness

## Examining Our Article, and Particular Sentence Structures

- After creating our macro context, we should focus on the order of our introduction (and headings) and our connections between one another
    
- To provide a connection between one sentence to another, we use mutual words, called by Koray as anchor segments. We utilise some of the words, or lexical relations of the words in the next sentence for greater discourse integration
    
- Once we complete the macro context introduction, we utilise the contextual terms, and other word sequences used in the supplementary and micro contexts at the bottom of our introduction.
    
- When we have a representative image (representative of our macro context), we qualify it/introduce it with the sentence before it is placed (similar to a list or table).
    
- The first sentence that comes after the heading is crucial for our webpage to be crawled, as they are able to use predictive information retrieval to determine the cost of crawling our page
    

# Lecture 68 - First Word Sequence

## Utilisation Of Key Knowledge Domain Terms and Contextual Terms

- There are certain words in each article that belong to either the entire article (the macro context), and certain words the belong to particular sections (headings) of the article and don’t really appear across the whole article
    
- These words that appear only in particular sections appear with the words that appear across the whole article to make different co-occurrences between these terms
    
- When it comes to initial ranking, it’s important to give richer and more dense co-occurrence matrices to reflect the context in a better way for greater quantitative score from the search engine
    

  

# Lecture 69 - Auditing Distributional Semantics

- If a key term you are defining has a lot of different contexts, and therefore different definitions within those contexts (physical performance in the bedroom has a different meaning than of that in a weightlifting competition), you could/should specify the context in which you are defining the key concept. This allows for greater relevance to our particular concept, and makes the rest of that section make more sense in relation to this definition.
    
- Koray utilises a lot of the first sentences after the headings with an important contextually related noun, typically reiterating and defining the most important context term in the heading or connecting the macro context directly to it.
    

  

# Lecture 70 - Consensus and Modalities (Formal Semantics)

## Correctly Citing and Obtaining Research and Studies

- When utilising a named entity, that’s a particular form of research, we should include it’s name in quotation marks when we utilise information from this study.
    
- We should integrate all these into our article for the relevant educational literature: 
    

- The research 
    
- Researcher
    
- Research organisation
    
- Date of research 
    
- Topic of research 
    
- Subject count of research
    

- We can use google scholar, or other research organisations for key resources related to our topics
    
- We can also use key researchers and their related works for research to use
    
- We can also use the consensus app to get a key consensus and the most important pieces of research
    

  

# Lecture 71 - Exact Denitive and Declarative Answers

## Key Considerations For Answer Creation

- According to the question and question format we are asking, the answer format should reflect the question being asked.
    
- If you are answering a can or could question with a present tense fact sentence, there is a mismatch between the answer and question format
    
- If we use can,could or might/may, we are talking based on the researches
    
- If we use should we are referring to our personal experience and suggestion
    
- Koray also utilises both the different measurements, when giving specific units (for example Kilos and LB’s) and the conversions of those units to show human effort, expertise, and making us more relevant for different queries and locales
    

  

# Lecture 72 - Using Inquisitive Semantics for Answer Routes

## Answer Optimisation For Generated Questions

- We should always give our declaration (answer) first, then cite our research or researches after the we have given the answer as a form of supporting evidence to what we just said
    
- When we have a hard to use anchor text, we are able to utilise a rhetorical question
    

- ‘However, When asking ‘how much water should you drink a day’
    

- When we have a contextual connection from one article to another, and we ask the specific question of the article in another, we are able to give an overall summative  answer within the article we are linking, including the key points that will be discussed in the individual article
    
- For a question that doesn’t have a concrete answer, we are able to give an initial declaration, and give the conditions in which it makes sense, but also to mention the ‘other side’ of the answer. We should always ‘protect’ the format of the question.
    
- Koray consistently relinks the sections within the supplementary content, back to the key benefits listed in the main section, which allows for greater connection between these two parts, and overall greater content configuration, as it all makes more sense within these contexts
    

  

# Lecture 73 - Bending Meaning and Context (Talking to Search Engine)

## Analysis Of Supplementary Content, and Contextual Content 

- We should consider in our root articles, how we are going to be able to connect our source context to particular aspects, and show the search engine the connection of our topic with our source 
    
- When we don’t have a specific contextual layer in the contextual vector, we can add it to different sections throughout to make this point. 
    

  

# Lecture 74 - Constructing a Knowledge Base (Consistent E-A-V)

## Consistent Answers For Knowledge Base Creation

- Whenever we touch on a key section in one article that has its own article, we want to provide consistent answers throughout that section, and the individual web page for the article. This allows for better quality throughout by google, and greater consolidation of our answer
    
- When creating a list or table, we must utilise the most important contextual terms in conjunction within each section of a list or table (and the main macro context)
    
- If we are able to use multiple unique images in a communicative way to the search engine through reflecting the context or contexts of each section it will also help for further quality
    

  

# Lecture 75 - Represented and Representative Questions and Expansion of Evidence

  
  

# Lecture 76 - Content Configuration with Algorithmic Authorship

- We don’t always have to use a different fact and resource within our multiple articles, as long as the fact is relevant in each case and can be connected to the macro or micro contexts within the article
    
- Even if we include a part of another article, in one of our articles we should always ensure the information is consistent (and sometimes it might be enough to justify internal linking).
    
- Based on Koray’s Saigon speech, we provide greater context/adjectives when we are describing something like symptoms that has a variety of different ‘classifications’ (Mild, Severe, moderate) being more specific than our competitors. 
    
- When you have a plurality it’s easier to utilise these opportunities for creative, and simple images explaining our listing or plurality
    

  
  

# Lecture 77 - Page and Segment-side Context, Answer, Topicality Terms

- When we utilise a list within our headings (for something like symptoms, benefits etc), we should always ensure that we connect it to our macro context
    
- If there is a particular thing that is connected two sibling terms to one another, we should make sure we introduce the sibling term alongside our main one in that particular section with the thing.
    

  

# Lecture 78 - Question and Answer Formats with Neural Matching

- We want to use measurement units and the conversions, if we are able to use more of them than our competitors it’s great for greater relevance
    
- To be able to associate a research within a section, that we are utilising it we can quote a section of the research in the article
    
- If we are unable to deepen a particular context (like animals) use the most representative aspect to for that context (like pets - specifically dogs and cats)
    

  

# Lecture 79 - Contextual Domains and Layers in Answer Construction

- The query vocabulary and a document vocabulary should match, if you have a macro context with the word bad, we will try to mimic the word especially in our earliest sentence to match the ‘query network’ or macro contexts
    

# Lecture 80 - Creating Quality Nodes for Changing Search Engine's Perception 

- Sometimes at the beginning Koray utilises the ‘brand approach’, by giving the brand name (or the pronoun we) we give our expert opinion on the particular manner, to reflect we are the expert source (Topical Authority).
    
- If there’s no consensus on a particular sub topic, or section, we can explain both sides, in terms of there being anecdotal experience, and there being no scientific backing or conflicting studies to ensure we are relevant and more responsive to all queries.

# Lecture 40 - Contextual Structure with Algorithmic Rules

[[{TA} Lecture 43 - Contextual Border]]

## Lecture 43 - Contextual Border


# Lecture 43 - Contextual Border

> ## More Rules
> 
> - ‘Exact Definitive Answer’ - Means the first sentence used to answer the question, will be giving the answer directly, precisely, and with certainty. 
>     
> 
> -  Meaning we aren’t giving the answer with a ‘modality’ - Like should, may, might or can when giving the answer, we directly give the fact
>     
> 
> - ‘Expansion Of Evidence’ - We expand the answer further with evidence, as a form of support, using different types of representatives of the main answers.

> 
> - Also provide relevant extras - measurements, and different considerations
>     
> - List definition - Which means using a sentence to define a list. Use a full sentence when defining a list
>     
> - ‘Descriptive List Definition’ - Giving a different and variative, definition of the benefits of drinking water, in a way you can connect the section, and the following headings/sections, by giving criterion
>     
> - Listing - A list is utilised to answer the particular heading/contextual vector.
>     
> 
> - We outline the total number of list elements (how many answers on the list)



## Lecture 44 - Microsemantics


## More Rules
- ‘Exact Definitive Answer’ - Means the first sentence used to answer the question, will be giving the answer directly, precisely, and with certainty. 
-  Meaning we aren’t giving the answer with a ‘modality’ - Like should, may, might or can when giving the answer, we directly give the fact
- ‘Expansion Of Evidence’ - We expand the answer further with evidence, as a form of support, using different types of representatives of the main answers.
- We are also giving different types of phrase sequences with different context variations
- Also provide relevant extras - measurements, and different considerations
- List definition - Which means using a sentence to define a list. Use a full sentence when defining a list
- ‘Descriptive List Definition’ - Giving a different and variative, definition of the benefits of drinking water, in a way you can connect the section, and the following headings/sections, by giving criterion
- Listing - A list is utilised to answer the particular heading/contextual vector.
- We outline the total number of list elements (how many answers on the list)

## Lecture 45 - Predicates, Nouns, and Distributing Contextual Relevance


- In order to be more relevant to the main query network, we must process the alternative contexts to the individual query network (Predicate, and qualifier). Using the alternatives as substitute contexts for it 
- Content item briefs aren’t static prior to creation of the articles, they are dynamic and change in alignment with the other nodes, seeds, roots (articles) and queries. Especially, as it pertains to anchor text (contextual connections), Contextual Hierarchy and contextual vectors (headings)
- Anchor text changes from 9 to 14 signs you’re drinking too much water
- We can distribute the ‘left over’ context terms that aren’t mentioned within the supplementary content (bottom part)

## Lecture 46 - Conditional Synonym Phrases in Macro Contexts


Contextual Vector - Micro and Macro Context Based On The Queries

- The main H1 heading is a conditional synonym phrase, with the answer and is the search query that appears the most in the queries - What happens when you drink too much water? (Water Intoxication) 
- The first Anchor text, and structured piece of content (list, table etc) 
- If you want to increase relevance and ranking, the first structured content, should always be within the macro context - Typically on the most important context (Attribute) 
- Too Much Water is a synonym of Water intoxication, in the real world, however, it’s crucial to be able to see this within the queries (Koray is unable to do so), if you’re able to look through the queries and find a different word sequence, that is apart of that query network, it means that google has identified this as a synonym for main phrase or keyword for that query network, and is therefore good to use as a synonym. However, if we are unable to see it in the queries, it is a decision that needs to be considered. 
- We can attempt to fix Google's perception of a topical, and increasing topical consolidation by creating multiple pages for different query networks where necessary. Even if there is some overlap between the web pages that rank for these queries, there is a need for this distinction.

## Lecture 47 - Contextual Consolidation within Vectors


- Koray’s purpose for using H2’s (or in this case) is to have borders, and consolidations for certain sections - The H2’s answer the H1, The H3’s answer the H2’s, and the H4’s answer the H3’s
- Based upon the importance of a particular H2, we are able to expand the context and sharpen it further with h3’s, h4’s and other types of questions to ensure we are completely covering that part of the query network, based on the search demand and [filtration of the attributes](https:docs.google.com/document/d/12Q3pyo7Q8lavyPrmlTBXCc1KRwOMcqrUneN8FAOdI2s/edit?fbclid=IwAR1vrmkA19RZFcZtpHcCdtASFE9qlyfA2Pl4TQkbO0QYNIz-VEVSTfR_UTo#heading=h.k7x2k2cuql2p).
- The way we rank certain things in an order, that aren’t sequential, is through their popularity (overall) and popularity to the entit
- Ensure we give more ‘Symptoms’ or more of the key attribute for that particular sub section
- H3’s get there context from the ‘root’ question in the H2
- We always want to focus on antonyms (or opposites) within the supplementary content
- We always should use a query template and use the most important context for it


## Lecture 48 - Knowledge-base Construction within Definitions


## Outline Of Intro
1. We begin with a definition of the macro context and the main entity
2. We go to the main sections (or samples of the attributes given)
3. We then give the justification (especially for the relevant bridges), for our contextual connections 
4. All done in the order of the article
    
## Considerations
- The purpose of the intro is to justify the whole article in terms of order, and internal links, and lay the foundations/preview of what is to come
- Especially sub context sections (H2’s) must always be reflected in the intro, in the same order.

## Lecture 49 - Balancing Contextual Coverage


- The purpose of not addressing the most important context of symptoms, straight away, is to increase relevance to the contextual vector (of symptoms) and to rank for the question template, or question query. Hence we expand on the question with the representatives of that question
- We do minimise the amount/length of content within the less important parts in the main content
- Defining what we are talking about before, we begin talking about it
- The H2’s act as ‘sub articles’, and summaries of the h3 in a sense

## Another rule
- Preceding question 
- Using positive language within the YMYL niche, will help for further rankings


## Lecture 50 - Structuring Context with Macro and Micro Semantics


- We have to ensure that our supplementary section isn't too irrelevant from the main content. Hence, Koray links back to the main content at the end of the article.
    
- The specific context, phrases, and keywords in the macro context (H1), will appear throughout the webpage/article, but the words that appear in particular sections won’t appear in the following sections. But there is always a mention of the macro context, context terms in conjunction with other micro contexts.
    
- For example - The phrase ‘drinking too much water’, and ‘water intoxication’, will be mentioned throughout the whole article, considering they’re the macro context.
    
- Key phrases or context terms that relate to subsections like nausea, or the colour of urine, will be mentioned within it’s section, but will not extend past it’s section. 
    
- The only exception to the rule, might be justifying your internal links (contextual connections).


## Lecture 51 - Turning Queries into Headings


## The Query Lists For Content item briefs 
- The query lists are ordered based upon according to the order that the keywords rank for the particular URL’s
    
## What happens if the queries are explicit questions?
- We will need to deepen the question context, and ask different variations of the specific questions
    
- After determining the specific macro context (H1), we then begin to variate the question, based on the most important contexts (think lexical relations).
    
- Koray touches on sub parts of the macro context, then siblings of the macro context, in variating the question in the macro context
    
## Contextual Connection 
- This contextual connection to the root article, isn’t mentioned in the introduction, but it’s mentioned within the supplementary content, and it’s micro context
    
- The purpose of it being given within a boolean question and a H4 is because, it allows for a more specific anchor text, and also signifies less relevance to be passed through the internal link


## Lecture 52 - Including Answer Terms with Contextual Flow


## Article Methodology - Intro
- Defining the most important entity and word sequence, identified in the macro context, at the onset of the article
    
- Then we answer the most important question, related to our topic/macro context
    
- Overall, we are trying to reflect the macro and micro contexts we are going to discuss, we try to implement them within the order they are addressed, as much as possible.

## Featured Snippets - Overall Article
- In the featured snippets, information density is very important - Even if someone asks for the male percentage, we include the female percentage (or the ‘sibling’ context).
    
- Koray utilises very similar questions with only a different gender inserted, in order to be able to ‘grab’ both the female and male snippets.
    
- He further optimises this with his sentence structure, by ensuring the dominant context he is ‘pursuing’ (male or female in this case), is emphasised in the question, and the sentence structure giving more weight to the particular context term, then the less important context term based on the question. 
    
- Koray also talks about his ‘bridge’, where he discusses the water percentage in animal bodies, he compares animal bodies to human bodies, utilising numerical values, and percentages. This is crucial as it relates to click satisfaction scores, and understanding your questions, considering the question explicitly states the need for a percentage, including percentages, numerical values, key words or phrases related to a percentage or the change in it (increase, decrease etc), will increase click satisfaction scores possibilities. 

## Lecture 53 - Matching and Signalling Anchor Text Terms


## Contextual Connection Justification 
- Koray uses a different then previously mentioned, he utilises the heading to signal/signify that the result, as a result of the process also in the contextual vector, is related to a larger subset (benefits), therefore justifying it’s placement there. This makes sense as ‘losing weight’ is one benefit of drinking water, hence there is some relevance between the question, answer, and contextual connection. I think this is also the purpose for the h4 heading because it’s relevant but not the most relevant, also indicated by the h4. 
    
- Answer terms - the terms used to answer certain questions 
    
- Koray utilises the answer terms to signify, and therefore justify the context he is referring to within the contextual vector 

- Utilising body functions within the h2 above, which is an answer term for the benefits, to justify internal linking.
    
## Hidden Columns
- Unique Information Gain Score
- Preceding question
- Annotation text

## Lecture 54 - Using Boolean Questions in Queries


## Contextual Vector - Boolean Question
- If you have a heading with a boolean question, we add certain contextual terms (risks and benefits in this case) to the heading (to expand the context to write an article I assume) of our macro context, for an explicit question query. 
    
- The more we increase the similarity between query vocabulary (And semantic role labels), and document vocabulary, the greater the information retrieval score (no matter the iteration of IR). 
    
- If we have a boolean question in our macro context, we should use the similar variations within our contextual hierarchy (will help for ranking). 
    
- To emphasise a contextual connection (internal link), using a variation of the macro context of that other webpage, to justify linking it within that page.
    
- With a boolean question as our macro context, the length of the article remains shorter, similar to the answer of the boolean question. 

## Lecture 55 - Consolidating Contextual Relevance


## Analysis Of Queries For Contextual Vector Creation
- Koray takes a general look at the queries, and sees the consistent contextual terms that are within the queries, then checks (through Ctrl + F) the variations, and context terms of the query network.
    
- This allows Koray to utilise ‘distributional semantics’, where the most important context terms within the queries (also based on the number of times they appear in the query network), must be included in some sense within the contextual vector.
    
- Based on themes of the words, even if a word appears within the terms more than another, we may use a synonym instead, if the theme (more relevant to our knowledge domain) of the synonym is more relevant than the one in the queries. 
  
## Quality Nodes
- The purpose of a quality node is supposed to be a webpage, that we prove our quality and authority relative to our competitors
    
- Quality nodes are extremely long, and detailed
    
- As opposed to a boolean question webpage, it’s only for ranking for that query (hence it’s less detailed and shorter).

## Lecture 56 - Using Antonyms for Contextual Bridges


## Justifying Contextual Connections 
- Utilising the phrase in the heading that we are going to use in our anchor text allows for greater justification relevance, and pagerank to be passed through our internal links.
    
- If we are able to use the phrases that will appear in the next heading, in the previous headings paragraphs (or subordinate text), will allow for greater justification of contextual flow, and greater 
    
- Stick with consensus given by the authoritative sources, at least until we are an authority ourselves
    
- A lot of these micro ‘configurations’ (micro semantics), are crucial to the contextual flow, between the macro context, bridge, and micro context, along with the justification of contextual connections to other content pieces within our topical map. 

## Lecture 57 - Phrase Sequences and Distributional Semantics


- Koray utilises colons within the headings to ensure majority of the relevance calculation is given towards the first part of the heading (before the colon)
    
- Drinking Hot Water: Health Benefits and Risks
    
- The part after the colon is to signal the flow, and sequence of the article
    
- We check those queries, and use the overall weight, and context of those queries, and a look at the documents to help generate the best contextual vectors

## Lecture 58 - Using Multiple Content Format in a Single Web Document


## Contextual Vector Adjustments
- If we ask a question with the term ‘what’, with a plural term inside that question, and the question doesn’t require for us to explain something methodological, or a cause or result, we just go with the ‘nouns’ (the named entities) that are most relevant to our particular section.
    
- Considering, less words within the heading allows for greater ‘weight’ to be distributed in the [embeddings](https:en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding) of the particular words within the relevance calculations. 
    
- To increase the relevance further, we use these terms within our headings earlier
    
- We are always finding efficient contexts to connect, and transition from different micro contexts to one another. For example from Benefits to risks, we use misunderstandings (it’s somewhat neutral between the two).
    
- The more we use a particular ‘phrase/word sequence’ and the topical terms throughout our websites entirety, the more relevance sitewide to the particular topic

## Lecture 59 - Lemmatization in Contextual Vector


#### Basically... use questions

## Lecture 60 - Creating Information Extraction Points


## Key Configurations Within The Article
- The Introduction of this quality node is the same for as the one given in the root article, with a following of the order of the article, and a definition of the most important phrase/part of our macro context (H1) (Drinking Hot Water), along with our [extractive and abstractive](https:docs.google.com/document/d/12Q3pyo7Q8lavyPrmlTBXCc1KRwOMcqrUneN8FAOdI2s/edit?fbclid=IwAR1vrmkA19RZFcZtpHcCdtASFE9qlyfA2Pl4TQkbO0QYNIz-VEVSTfR_UTo#heading=h.q2owp58i3zsh) summary
    
- The purpose of placing our answer within the grouper question (as a list), and within our contextual hierarchy as a list, is for increasing the chance of a featured snippet 
    
- Let the h2 be a summary for the h3’s, especially if they’re list
    
- Order for the list (of benefits) is given based upon the [attribute filtration](https:docs.google.com/document/d/12Q3pyo7Q8lavyPrmlTBXCc1KRwOMcqrUneN8FAOdI2s/edit?fbclid=IwAR1vrmkA19RZFcZtpHcCdtASFE9qlyfA2Pl4TQkbO0QYNIz-VEVSTfR_UTo#heading=h.cee3viqjjp71) discussed before hand

## Lecture 61 - Sequence Modeling and Canonical Queries


## Unique N Grams - Sequence Modelling
- When inspecting or processing a query network, we will realise some of them are canonical or representative queries.
    
- Google is able to predict or assign a probability of the next or proceeding word in a sentence, or query based upon the words already used, otherwise known as sequence modelling.
    
- Google also use this for ‘query refinements’ 
    
- If we are able to give unique ‘n-grams’ with unique phrases, we are perceived as an authority, as we are able to give unique and new information.
    
- We are able to use different lexical relationships (specifically hyponyms), to provide these unique n grams, particularly if there are some of these context terms that are in the query, we can use them and variate them further based on lexical relations to provide ‘unique n-grams’.
    
- We should do this within the supplementary content, when the queries are really clear in relation to the contexts (contextual signals), that they want discussed for that query network
    
- We must ensure there is a proper contextual flow, by ensuring that our main content (that discusses particular contexts) is logically, and fluently linked to the supplementary content or parts where we can provide unique n grams and unite different ideas, and concepts to prove our topical authority

## Lecture 62 - Reading Query Networks


## Analysing Query Networks
- When choosing a webpage, that we are ‘targeting’ for creating our contextual vector, we must ensure that the webpage isn’t ranking just for ‘pagerank’ (or exogenous factors), we must choose a page that is ranking because of its overall and proven topical authority, and unique information.
    
- From a broad perspective, in our contextual vector, we are trying to align the various different word sequences (phrases) that are contextually associated with our base macro context (or the most important phrase in our macro context). This is based on sequence modelling where we are connecting the most probable, next words or previous words that will appear alongside our macro context phrase

- For example the context and subsequent phrase of ‘ph of drinking water’ appears to be the most important context (hence it’s the macro context), and is connected to different phrases throughout like ‘high ph drinking water’ ‘low ph drinking water’, but under the guise of particular aspects like harms.

## Lecture 63 - Using Multiple Contextual Domains in Main Content


## Arrangement Of The Contextual Vector
- If we have an image ‘annotation’ in the contextual structure, and we use the particular phrase within our paragraphs we will need to generate the actual image
    
- We utilise our supplementary content to build our contextual bridges for the justification of our internal links

## Lecture 64 - Connecting Attributes of Central Entity


## Micro Semantic Configurations For Our Article
- Within the intro Koray defines the pH of water, then goes on to define what pH is on its own without the context of water. This showcases the importance of defining our core concepts of our article, and the slight differences of the concept in a different context
    
- If we are able to use the key concepts we are discussing within our images (in a chart or whatever the image is), then it will help for further relevance, and responsiveness, for being served on google
    
- Query Networks (unless they’re an explicitly question network) will typically have a few or multiple representative queries, that are representative of the query network, the contexts, and the main topics, and sub topics that need to be addressed within the article


## Lecture 65 - Data to Website


- Justifying the internal link/contextual connection by placing it in an earlier paragraph doesn’t just mean placing the exact phrase that is being used in the anchor text, it means inserting the predicate earlier 
    
- Since it takes time to process certain parts of our topical map, we should include the definition of all the main entities (nouns), sitewide to ensure greater relevance, and connection to the proper parts of the parts of the topical map that we are going to touch on in the future


## Lecture 66 - Auditing Article Relevance and Responsiveness


## Examining Transference Of Content Brief to Article
1. Koray places the article and the brief next to one another on a singular page
2. Check The Headings if they match the brief
3. The headings hierarchy - h1,h2 etc
4. Check each paragraph under each heading, in conjunction with the article methodology
    
## Article Considerations and Author Rules
- Koray doesn’t allow the authors to edit the contextual vector, especially the order of the ‘nouns’ or named entities, or the predicates, but might allow for some changes in the methodology 
    
- Koray recommends to ensure the h2 heading, the font size, and weight, aren’t bigger than the h1, when going deeper in the hierarchy using 4 pixel smaller and lower font weight
    
- Koray typically uses three examples when introducing a key concept, or giving a contextual connection
    
- We are trying to be connected to all different contexts by optimising word proximity and co-occurrences

## Lecture 67 - Auditing Order of Declarations and Completeness


## Examining Our Article, and Particular Sentence Structures

- After creating our macro context, we should focus on the order of our introduction (and headings) and our connections between one another
    
- To provide a connection between one sentence to another, we use mutual words, called by Koray as anchor segments. We utilise some of the words, or lexical relations of the words in the next sentence for greater discourse integration
    
- Once we complete the macro context introduction, we utilise the contextual terms, and other word sequences used in the supplementary and micro contexts at the bottom of our introduction.
    
- When we have a representative image (representative of our macro context), we qualify it/introduce it with the sentence before it is placed (similar to a list or table).
    
- The first sentence that comes after the heading is crucial for our webpage to be crawled, as they are able to use predictive information retrieval to determine the cost of crawling our page

## Lecture 68 - First Word Sequence


## Utilisation Of Key Knowledge Domain Terms and Contextual Terms

- There are certain words in each article that belong to either the entire article (the macro context), and certain words the belong to particular sections (headings) of the article and don’t really appear across the whole article
    
- These words that appear only in particular sections appear with the words that appear across the whole article to make different co-occurrences between these terms
    
- When it comes to initial ranking, it’s important to give richer and more dense co-occurrence matrices to reflect the context in a better way for greater quantitative score from the search engine

- [Multisearch & Multijump](https:chromewebstore.google.com/detail/multi-search-multi-jump/oahidkobkdbfbknbloljgpjbeaefgapa?pli=1)

## Lecture 69 - Auditing Distributional Semantics


- If a key term you are defining has a lot of different contexts, and therefore different definitions within those contexts (physical performance in the bedroom has a different meaning than of that in a weightlifting competition), you could/should specify the context in which you are defining the key concept. This allows for greater relevance to our particular concept, and makes the rest of that section make more sense in relation to this definition.
    
- Koray utilises a lot of the first sentences after the headings with an important contextually related noun, typically reiterating and defining the most important context term in the heading or connecting the macro context directly to it.

## Lecture 70 - Consensus and Modalities (Formal Semantics)


## Correctly Citing and Obtaining Research and Studies
- When utilising a named entity, that’s a particular form of research, we should include it’s name in quotation marks when we utilise information from this study.

- We should integrate all these into our article for the relevant educational literature: 
    - The research 
	- Researcher
    - Research organisation
    - Date of research 
    - Topic of research 
    - Subject count of research

- We can use google scholar, or other research organisations for key resources related to our topics

- We can also use key researchers and their related works for research to use

- We can also use the consensus app to get a key consensus and the most important pieces of research

## Lecture 71 - Exact Definitive and Declarative Answers


Lecture 71 - Exact Definitive and Declarative Answers

## Key Considerations For Answer Creation
- According to the question and question format we are asking, the answer format should reflect the question being asked.
    
- If you are answering a can or could question with a present tense fact sentence, there is a mismatch between the answer and question format
    
- If we use can,could or might/may, we are talking based on the researches
    
- If we use should we are referring to our personal experience and suggestion
    
- Koray also utilises both the different measurements, when giving specific units (for example Kilos and LB’s) and the conversions of those units to show human effort, expertise, and making us more relevant for different queries and locales
