## EMAIL 1: LAUNCH ANNOUNCEMENT

**Send Timing:** Day 0 (Launch Week Monday)
**PASAIDA Element:** Problem
**Subject Line:** I'm launching something you'll either love or ignore
**Preview Text:** SEO education for people who don't have time for SEO education.

### Email Body

Most SEO courses assume you have time to master SEO.

You don't. You have 12 other priorities, and SEO is somewhere between "important" and "I'll get to it next quarter."

The problem with generic SEO education is it teaches you what consultants do. People who control entire strategies, have direct developer access, and can say "we're shipping this" without negotiating for engineering time or proving ROI before getting budget.

That's not your reality.

You're trying to fit SEO into an org chart that doesn't have an SEO-shaped hole. You need to know what to prioritize, how to scope it for the teams who'll execute it, and how to prove value to people who measure everything in short-term revenue.

That's what SEO By Role is.

Not "everything you need to know about SEO." Just the 3-5 high-leverage plays for your specific role, broken into execution chunks that don't require perfect conditions or special permissions.

Mini-courses for Product Managers, Developers, Marketing Managers, CMOs, Content Teams, and Founders. Each one built around the constraints and politics you actually face.

Launching this week. If you want early access and the lowest price it'll ever be, keep reading.

## EMAIL 2: WHAT'S INSIDE (AND WHAT'S NOT)

**Send Timing:** Day 1 (Launch Week Tuesday)
**PASAIDA Element:** Solution
**Subject Line:** Here's what's inside (and what's deliberately not)
**Preview Text:** No fluff. No "SEO 101" you've heard 50 times.

### Email Body

SEO By Role courses follow the same structure regardless of which role you're in. Here's the breakdown.

**Week 1-2: What You Actually Control**

The fastest way to fail at SEO is trying to own things outside your authority.

If you're a Product Manager, you don't control content velocity. If you're a Developer, you don't set keyword strategy. If you're a Marketing Manager, you don't dictate engineering priorities.

These two weeks map exactly what falls under your scope, what you should delegate with clear ownership, and what you should stop worrying about entirely.

Includes: authority mapping worksheet, quick-win audit (one thing you can ship this week), and role-specific responsibility checklist.

**Week 3-4: Building the Business Case**

Your stakeholders don't care about keyword rankings. They care about outcomes: revenue, acquisition cost, competitive position.

These weeks teach you how to pitch SEO in language that gets budget approved. Not SEO language. Business language.

Includes: 6 stakeholder pitch templates (copy/paste for your next meeting), RICE scoring worksheet for prioritizing SEO against roadmap items, and ROI modeling spreadsheet that survives "show me the numbers" scrutiny.

**Week 5-8: Execution Playbooks**

Four high-leverage SEO plays, scoped specifically for your role. Each one includes step-by-step execution, cross-functional coordination notes, and criteria for knowing when it's working.

Includes: collaboration frameworks for working with dev/content/product without creating dependencies that stall projects, and guidelines for when to push back on SEO requests that hurt your actual goals.

**Week 9-12: Measuring and Reporting**

Dashboards leadership will actually read. Metrics connected to business outcomes, not vanity metrics that impress SEO people but confuse everyone else.

Includes: reporting templates, quarterly retrospective framework, and guidance on when to double down versus when to kill underperforming initiatives.

---

**What's NOT inside:**

- "How search engines work" explainers
- 47-step technical audits you'll never complete
- Keyword research tutorials you can find anywhere
- Theory without execution context

This is a playbook, not a textbook.

**Price this week:** $97 (goes to $197 after launch)

## EMAIL 3: WHY THIS DOESN'T EXIST ANYWHERE ELSE

**Send Timing:** Day 2 (Launch Week Wednesday)
**PASAIDA Element:** Authority
**Subject Line:** Why this doesn't exist anywhere else
**Preview Text:** Everyone teaches SEO. No one teaches navigating the org chart.

### Email Body

There are 10,000 SEO courses online. I've taken or reviewed maybe 40 of them over the past eight years.

They all teach the same thing: keyword research, link building, technical audits, content optimization.

That's not your bottleneck.

Your bottleneck is:

Getting engineering to prioritize SEO work when the roadmap is full of revenue-driving features. Justifying SEO investment to executives who want paid-advertising-style attribution. Coordinating with content teams when you don't control editorial calendar. Proving SEO worked when rankings improved but traffic didn't move the way the forecast promised.

No one teaches that. Because most SEO educators are consultants who've never had to navigate an org chart, fight for budget against other priorities, or watch their SEO project get deprioritized in sprint planning for the third time.

I've been on all sides.

Agency side: managing retainers for clients ranging from $1,500/month local businesses to $15,000/month enterprise accounts. Learning what works when you control strategy but not execution.

In-house side: embedded with marketing teams, product teams, engineering teams. Learning what stalls projects and what actually ships.

Founder side: building businesses where SEO was the primary acquisition channel. Learning what matters when organic traffic is your lifeline, not a nice-to-have.

The courses I built contain the patterns that worked across all three contexts. Not because they're theoretically sound, but because they survived contact with real organizations.

**What that looks like in practice:**

A Product Manager used the RICE scoring methodology from Week 3 to get two SEO tickets prioritized over planned feature work. Both shipped in the next sprint. First time in nine months any SEO work made it into production.

A Marketing Manager used the attribution reframing from Week 4 to show leadership that SEO was influencing 23% of closed deals, not the 4% last-click attribution was showing. Budget increased the following quarter.

A Developer used the "when to push back" framework from Week 8 to kill an SEO request that would have broken accessibility standards. Protected the codebase and earned trust from the SEO team for future collaboration.

$97 this week. $197 after.

## EMAIL 4: THE ONE QUESTION THAT TELLS ME IF THIS IS FOR YOU

**Send Timing:** Day 3 (Launch Week Thursday)
**PASAIDA Element:** Agitation
**Subject Line:** The one question that tells me if this is for you
**Preview Text:** If you answered yes, you need this. If no, you don't.

### Email Body

Here's the question:

**Do you know what needs to happen next in SEO, but you can't get it prioritized, resourced, or approved?**

If yes, this course is for you.

If your problem is "I don't know what good SEO looks like," you need a different resource. There are plenty of them. Ahrefs has a free course. Moz has a beginner guide. SEMrush has tutorials. They'll teach you keyword research, technical audits, link building fundamentals.

But if you already know what needs to happen and the bottleneck is execution—getting buy-in, coordinating across teams, proving value to stakeholders who don't speak SEO—then this is the only course built for that problem.

Here's what the execution bottleneck actually looks like:

**For Product Managers:** You've identified SEO opportunities worth pursuing. But engineering says "we don't have capacity." You can't prove ROI without shipping the work, and you can't get the work shipped without proving ROI. Classic catch-22.

**For Marketing Managers:** You know SEO is contributing to pipeline, but your attribution model shows it at 3% contribution while paid shows 40%. Leadership keeps reallocating budget to channels with cleaner metrics. You're stuck explaining why "SEO takes time" in every budget review.

**For Developers:** Requests keep landing on your backlog: "fix page speed," "add structured data," "optimize for mobile." None of them are scoped. None of them have acceptance criteria. You don't know what "done" looks like, so nothing gets estimated and nothing ships.

**For CMOs/Executives:** Your agency sends monthly reports full of jargon. Rankings went up. Traffic didn't. Revenue didn't. You don't know if the work is good or if you're funding busy work.

**For Content Teams:** You're told to "optimize for SEO" but the briefs are either nonexistent or so restrictive they kill your voice. Keywords feel like checkboxes instead of reader intent signals.

**For Founders:** You know you should invest in SEO eventually. You don't know if "eventually" is now, next quarter, or next year. And you're tired of SEO consultants promising page-one rankings without explaining what that actually means for revenue.

If any of those sound familiar, the course teaches you how to solve that specific problem for your specific role.

$97 through Sunday. $197 starting Monday.

## EMAIL 5: WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DON'T FIX THIS

**Send Timing:** Day 4 (Launch Week Friday)
**PASAIDA Element:** Deadline + Agitation
**Subject Line:** What happens if you don't fix this
**Preview Text:** SEO stays in the backlog. You stay stuck explaining why it's not your fault.

### Email Body

If you don't figure out how to navigate the politics, resource constraints, and prioritization battles around SEO, here's the trajectory:

**Quarter 1:** SEO stays in the backlog. You bring it up in planning meetings. It gets deprioritized for "higher-impact" work. You nod and move on.

**Quarter 2:** Same conversation. You've learned not to push too hard because you don't have the data to win the argument. SEO becomes "something we should do eventually."

**Quarter 3:** Competitor ships the content strategy you proposed six months ago. They're ranking for keywords you identified. You mention this in a meeting. Someone asks why you didn't execute faster.

**Quarter 4:** Leadership asks for a recommendation on SEO investment. You realize you don't have a compelling business case because nothing shipped. You can't prove ROI on work that never happened.

**Year 2:** Same position, same challenges, same conversations. The SEO opportunity is still there, but now you're a year behind competitors who figured out how to ship.

That's the cost of not solving the execution problem. Not that SEO doesn't work. That you never get to find out.

---

The alternative:

You spend 12 weeks learning how to operate within the constraints you actually have. Not pretending you control things you don't. Not waiting for perfect conditions. Just shipping high-leverage plays that move metrics leadership cares about.

At the end of those 12 weeks, you have:

A clear map of what you control and what you delegate. Stakeholder pitch templates that get budget approved. A prioritization framework that makes SEO compete fairly against roadmap items. Execution playbooks you've already started running. Dashboards showing impact in business terms.

That's the difference between "SEO is something we should do" and "SEO is delivering measurable results."

**$97 through Sunday.** $197 starting Monday.
